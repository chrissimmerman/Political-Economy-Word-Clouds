This project uses Andreas Mueller's word_cloud package to create word clouds of the classical economists main texts.

In particular, Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, David Ricardo's Principles of Political Economy, Thomas Robert Malthus' Essay on the Principle of Population and Principles of Political Economy are used.

Additionally, two works of female popularizers of political economy are drawn upon: Harriet Martineau's Illustrations of Political Economy and Jane Haldimand Marcet's Conversations on Political Economy.

The word clouds are generated using the portraits of the authors.

A number of conclusions can be drawn from the word clouds:

(1) Adam Smith had an exceptionally wide vocabulary.

(2) Harriet Martineau's _Illustrations_ were qualitatively different than Jane Haldimand Marcet's _Conversations_, despite the fact that Martineau drew her main inspiration from Marcet. Martineau predominantly wrote using literary language, while Marcet wrote using the vocabulary of political economy.

(3) Malthus' Essay on Population uses starkly different langauge than the other canonical works of classical political economy.
