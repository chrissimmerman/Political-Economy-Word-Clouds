# **Description**

This project uses Andreas Mueller's word_cloud package to create word clouds of the main texts of classical political economy and the marginal revolution.

In particular, the following texts are used:

  Adam Smith, _Wealth of Nations_ (1776),
  
  David Ricardo, _Principles of Political Economy_ (1817),
  
  Thomas Robert Malthus, _Essay on the Principle of Population_ (1803) and _Principles of Political Economy_ (1820),
  
  Jane Haldimand Marcet, _Conversations on Political Economy_ (1816),
  
  Harriet Martineau, _Illustrations of Political Economy_ (1833-4),
  
  John Stuart Mill, _Principles of Political Economy_ (1848),
  
  William Stanley Jevons, _Theory of Political Economy_ (1871),
  
  Carl Menger, _Principles of Economics_ (1871),
  
  Leon Walras, _Elements of Pure Economics_ (1874),
  
  John Bates Clark, _Philosophy of Wealth_ (1885),
  
  Alfred Marshall, _Principles of Economics_ (1890).

The colors, shapes, and texts of the word clouds are generated using the portraits of the authors. If the reader wishes to recreate the clouds, they can download the masks, texts, and programs, replace the relevant file paths in the programs, and then run the programs.


# **Conclusions**

(1) Adam Smith had an exceptionally wide vocabulary compared to the other two giants of classical economics.

(2) Harriet Martineau's _Illustrations_ are qualitatively different than Jane Haldimand Marcet's _Conversations_, despite the fact that Martineau drew her main inspiration from Marcet. Martineau predominantly wrote using literary language, while Marcet wrote using the vocabulary of political economy.

(3) Malthus' _Essay on Population_ uses starkly different langauge than the other canonical works of classical political economy.

(4) The marginal revolutionaries were more concerned with the psychological value derived by individuals than their political economist predecessors, as signified by the presence of the words like “utility”, “satisfaction”, and “pleasure.”

(5)  If the “marginal revolution” is defined as the penetration of the differential calculus into economics, it should be noted that few of the marginal revolutionaries wrote in explicitly mathematical language (see Jevons, Walras).

(6) Many of the same keywords which dominated classical political economy permeate the works of the marginal revolutionaries, indicating that the content the two schools concerned themselves with is essentially the same.

(7) The world was more industrialized by the time of the marginal revolutionaries, because keywords like “corn”, “country”, etc. are not as frequent as in the classical political economists.
