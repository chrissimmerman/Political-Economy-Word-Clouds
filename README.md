This project uses Andreas Mueller's word_cloud package to create word clouds of the classical economists main texts.
In particular, Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, David Ricardo's Principles of Political Economy, Thomas Robert Malthus' Essay on the Principle of Population and Principles of Political Economy are used.
Additionally, two works of female popularizers of political economy are drawn upon: Harriet Martineau's Illustrations of Political Economy and Jane Haldimand Marcet's Conversations on Political Economy.
The word clouds are generated using the portraits of the authors.
