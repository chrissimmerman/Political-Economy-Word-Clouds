Preface to the second edition1

I wrote, in June 1874, at the beginning of the irst part of the irst 
edition of the present work, the lines that I would like now to 
reproduce:
I am in debt to the enlightened initiative of the Council of State of Vaud 
that created a chair of economics in the School of Law of the Academy 
of Lausanne in 1870, and instituted a competition to select an occupant 
of the chair. It is especially to the benevolent conidence in me of Mr. 
Louis Ruchonnet, who is head of the Department of Public Education and 
Worship and member of the Swiss National Council, and who, ater having 
invited me to enter the competition for obtaining that chair, has not ceased 
to encourage me unsparingly since my occupancy of it, that I owe being 
able to begin the publication of a treatise on the elements of economics, 
arranged in accordance with a new plan, developed according to a novel 
method, and reaching conclusions that, I must state, will also difer on cer-
tain points from those of the present science.
his treatise is divided into three parts each forming a volume published 
in two fascicles. he books will be the following:
1st part: ― Éléments d’économie politique pure or héorie de la rich-
esse sociale.

1 his third edition difers from the second only by the elimination of the four 
lessons on the applied theory of money mentioned on page lvi, and by the add-
ition of three appendixes. – he second and the third parts, discussed on page liv, 
will be replaced by two volumes, Études d’économie sociale and Études d’économie 
politique appliquée. he applied theory of money will appear in the latter. I beg of 
my readers to be so kind as to accept this plan, which seems to me very nearly to 
achieve my œuvre more promptly, while relieving me of a task that I fear I am no 
longer capable of undertaking. (February 1896).

production agricole, industrielle et commercial de la richesse.
3rd part: ― ÉlÉments d’Économie sociale or héorie de la répartition de 
la richesse par la propriété et l’impôt.
he irst fascicle of the irst volume is presented here. It contains a math-
ematical solution of the problem of the determination of equilibrium prices 
and also a scientiic formulation of the law of supply and demand in the 
case of the exchange of any number of commodities for one another. I real-
ize that the notations used there will at irst appear a little complicated, but 
I beg the reader not to be discouraged by this complexity, which is inherent 
in the subject and which, besides, constitutes the only mathematical dif-
iculty. his system of notation once understood, the system of economic 
phenomena is, in a way, also thereby understood.
his half-volume was completely written and almost completely printed, 
and I had already communicated the principle of the theory expounded 
in it to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques in Paris,2 when, a 
month ago, my attention was drawn to a work on the same subject enti-
tled he heory of Political Economy, published in 1871 by Macmillan & 
Co. in London by Mr. W. Stanley Jevons, Professor of Political Economy at 
Manchester. hat author applies, as I do, mathematical analysis to economic 
theory, especially to the theory of exchange; and, what is really remarkable, 
he bases the whole of that application on a fundamental formula that he 
calls the equation of exchange, and that is rigorously identical to the for-
mula that serves as my point of departure and that I call the condition of 
maximum satisfaction.
Mr. Jevons is above all concerned with developing a general and philo-
sophical exposition of the new method, and with laying down the founda-
tions of its application to the theory of exchange, and to the theories of labor, 
land services, and capital. For my part, I have especially made an efort in the 
present half-volume to give a thorough exposition of the mathematical theory 
of exchange. It is only proper that I restore to Mr. Jevons the priority of his 
formula while retaining the right of priority for certain important deductions 
from it. I will not enumerate these points, which a competent public will be 
perfectly able to recognize. Let it suice for me to say that, in my opinion,

Journal des Économistes, April 1874.


Preface to the second edition V

the work of Mr. Jevons and my own, far from destroying each other, con-
irm, complement, and markedly enhance each other. hat is my irm convic-
tion, and I demonstrate it to be such by strongly recommending that eminent 
English economist’s excellent book to everyone who is not familiar with it.
he second part of the irst edition of my treatise was published in 
1877. In it, I developed a theory of the determination of the prices 
of productive services (wages, rent, and interest) and a theory of the 
determination of the rate of net income very diferent from those of 
Jevons.3
In 1879, Jevons, then professor at University College, London, 
published the second edition of his heory of Political Economy, 
and, in the preface of that edition (pp. XXXV–XLII), he partly con-
ceded to Gossen, a German, the priority of discovering the starting-
point of mathematical economics, which I had already conceded to 
Jevons, as indicated above. I consecrated to Gossen, in the Journal 
des Économistes for April and May 1885, an article titled ‘Un écono-
miste inconnu, Hermann-Henri Gossen’ in which I presented infor-
mation about his life and work, and made an efort to determine 
what remained as my own contribution ater the work of my two 
predecessors. At the end of lesson 16, which concludes part II of this 
volume, the reader will ind a section in which I return to this mat-
ter. It will be seen there that the importance of considering raretéii in 
the theory of exchange was again discovered and stressed, independ-
ently of the three of us, by Mr. Carl Menger, professor of economics 
at the University of Vienna, and, I hope it will be understood, that, 
given these circumstances, I feel it necessary to state with precision 
the respects in which my second edition difers from the irst.

3 Part I of the irst edition of the Éléments d’économie politique pure was summa-
rized in two memoirs entitled: Principe d’une théorie mathématique de l’échange 
and Équations de l’échange, the irst having been submitted to the Académie des 
sciences morales et politiques in Paris in August 1873, and the second to the 
Société Vaudoise des sciences naturelles at Lausanne in December 1875. Part II 
was summarized before its publication in two memoirs entitled: Équations de la 
production and Équations de la capitalisation, both submitted to the Société vau-
doise des sciences naturelles, the irst in January and February, and the second 
in July 1876. hese four memoirs were translated into Italian as Teoria matem-
atica della ricchezza sociale (Biblioteca dell’Economista, 1878) and in German 
as Mathematische heorie der Preisbestimmung der wirthschatlichen Güter 
(Stuttgart. Verlag von Ferdinand Enke, 1881).


VI Preface to the second edition

Stocks of the irst edition had been exhausted for several years; 
the publication of the second was delayed only by the studies that I 
had undertaken on the question of money.4 In order to introduce the 
results of my research in the present edition, I have placed ater the 
part on capital formation and credit the part on money, a part that, 
in the irst edition, came immediately ater the part on exchange. I 
put eight lessons into that part, numbered 33 to 40, of which four 
are on theory and four on applied economics. Among the irst four, 
I included two lessons, numbered 34 and 35, that contain my theory 
of bimetallism. Moreover, in the other lesson on economic theory, 
regarding the solution of the problem of the value of money, I sub-
stituted, in place of the demonstration founded on the concept of the 
‘needed monetary circulation’,iii which was an idea that I borrowed 
from the economistsiv and used in the irst edition of the Éléments 
d’économie politique pure, the demonstration, completed in the neces-
sary way, based on the concept of a ‘desired cash balance’ that I used 
in the héorie de la monnaie. Among the latter four lessons, I put two 
lessons, numbered 39 and 40, one with the critique of the doctrine of 
Cournot on the changes of absolute and relative value, which I took 
up from the part on exchange to introduce it in the part on money, 
and added to it the critique of Jevons’s doctrine on the same subject, 
and the other with the conclusions of my new theory regarding the 
regularization of the variation of the value of money. In all these les-
sons on applied theory, I substituted in place of the system of gold 
coinage with divisible silver tokens of the irst edition of the Éléments 
the system of gold coinage with divisible silver tokens and the regu-
latory silver tokens of the héorie. If we leave on one side the four 
applied theory lessons, that perhaps should have been moved to the 
Éléments d’économie politique appliquée, we have, in the four lessons 
on economic theory, the solution of the fourth great problem that 
arises in economic theory ater those of exchange, production, cap-
ital formation and credit: the problem of money.
4 Some of these are studies in economic theory: ― Note sur le 151/2 légal; ― héorie 
mathématique du bimétalisme; ― De la ixité de valeur de l’étalon monétaire 
(Journal des Économists, December 1876, May 1881, october 1882); they have 
been put into the present volume. he others, notably the héorie de la mon-
naie (1886), which are studies in applied economics, will be found in the Études 
d’économie politique appliquée. (February 1896).


Preface to the second edition VII

If I have enlarged considerably the part devoted to money, I have, 
on the other hand, made few important changes in the parts devoted 
to the three other problems. I have, in the part on exchange, added 
to the proof of the theorem of the maximum satisfactionv in the case 
of continuous utility curves, a proof for the case of discontinuous 
curves. I have improved upon several matters of detail in the solution 
of the equations of exchange, of production, of capital formation and 
of credit, while leaving it as it was in its overall presentation. I have 
established, in a new theorem, that the condition of equality of the 
rate of net income is also the condition of maximum utility for new 
capital goods. When I published my irst edition, I had seen only one 
of the two problems of the maximization of utility relative to the ser-
vices of new capital goods: that which presents itself with reference 
to the distribution by an individual of his income among his diverse 
wants, if it is assumed that the quantities of capital goods are given 
by the very nature of things or determined by chance. I call that, for 
short, the problem of the maximization of satisfaction of wants; it is 
solved mathematically by the proportionality of raretés to the prices 
of the services of the capital goods. However, in preparing the second 
edition, I became aware that there is a second problem: that which 
presents itself with reference to the distribution by a society of the 
excess of its income over its consumption among the diverse varieties 
of capital goods, when one seeks the determination of the quantities 
of new capital goods in view of the maximum of efective utility of 
their services. I call that the problem of the maximum utility of new 
capital goods; it is solved mathematically by the proportionality of 
the prices of the services to the prices of the goods, which is, subject 
to a single qualiication, precisely the result to which free competi-
tion leads.
I have slightly modiied the titles of my parts in order to mark 
better the order of the four problems of which I have spoken; and I 
have oten melded two or three lessons into one, not thinking it more 
useful to deal, in the treatise, with the division of the course into very 
short lessons.
Finally, I have added a mathematical introduction in which I have 
given the necessary guidance for the reading of the volume. I have 
proited from the opportunity to give that guidance in regard to 
derivatives and deinite integrals, which has enabled me to furnish 


VIII Preface to the second edition

from time to time the true formula for certain fundamental theo-
rems and to demonstrate the theorem of the maximum utility of new 
capital goods. I preface my course at the Academy of Lausanne with 
an analogous introduction, and I ind that a useful practice: it per-
mits those of my students who wish to do so to follow me without 
diiculty. If the introduction that I provide here gains me a single 
attentive reader more, my trouble will not be unrewarded.
As a consequence of these modiications, the outline of the volume 
now appears as follows:
Functions and their geometrical representation. Mathematical 
theory of the law of gravity.
ÉLÉMENTS D’ÉCoNoMIE PoLITIQUE PURE, or héorie de la richesse 
sociale.
Part I. object and divisions of economics. ― Part II. heory of 
exchange. ― Part III. heory of production. ― Part IV. heory of cap-
ital formation and credit. ― Part V. heory of money. ― Part VI. Price 
ixing, monopoly, and taxation.
However, the volume modiied in this way is still the second edi-
tion of the volume of 1874–1877. By that I mean that my present 
doctrine is just the same as it was iteen years ago. It can be sum-
marized as follows.
Economic theory is essentially the theory of the determination of 
prices in a hypothetical regime of perfectly free competition. he 
ensemble of all things, material or immaterial, on which a price can 
be set because they are scarce, that is to say, are both useful and lim-
ited in quantity, constitutes social wealth. hat is why economic the-
ory is also the theory of social wealth.
Among the things that make up social wealth a distinction must 
be made between capital goods, or, durable goods, which can be used 
more than once, and income goods, or, non-durable goods, which can-
not be used more than once. Capital goods comprise land, personal 
faculties, and capital goods properly speaking. Income goods comprise 
not only consumers’ goods and raw materials, which are, for the most 
part, material things, but they also include, under the name of ser-
vices, the successive uses of capital goods, services that are, in most 
instances, immaterial things. he services of capital goods that have 
a direct utility are put in the same class as consumers’ goods under 
the name consumers’ services; those services of capital goods that 


Preface to the second edition IX

have only indirect utility are put in the same class as raw materials 
under the name productive services. hat, in my opinion, is the key 
to all of economic theory. If the distinction between capital goods 
and income goods is neglected, and particularly if the immaterial 
services of capital goods are not put among social wealth along with 
material income, the possibility of a scientiic theory of the deter-
mination of prices is precluded. If, on the other hand, the proposed 
distinction and classiication are accepted, then it becomes possible 
to arrive successively, by means of the theory of exchange, at a deter-
mination of the prices of consumers’ goods and services; by means 
of the theory of production, at a determination of the prices of raw 
materials and productive services; by means of the theory of capital 
formation, at a determination of the price of ixed capital goods; and, 
by means of the theory of circulation, at a determination of the prices 
of circulating capital goods. Here is how this is done.
First, let us imagine a market in which only consumers’ goods and 
consumable services are bought and sold; that is to say, exchanged, 
the sale of any service being done by the hiring out of a capital good. 
he prices or the ratios of exchange of all these goods and services 
having been cried at random in terms of one of them selected as the 
numeraire, each party to the exchange ofers at these prices those 
goods or services of which he thinks he has relatively too much, and 
he demands those articles or services of which he thinks he has rela-
tively too little. he quantities of each item efectively demanded and 
supplied having thus been determined, the prices of those things for 
which the demand exceeds the supply are raised, and the prices of 
those things of which the supply exceeds the demand are lowered. At 
the new prices that are cried, each exchanger ofers and demands new 
quantities. And again, prices are made to rise or fall until the demand 
and the supply of each good or service is equal. At that point, the 
prices are current equilibrium prices and exchange takes place.
he problem of production is posed by introducing into the prob-
lem of exchange the circumstance that consumers’ goods are prod-
ucts resulting either from a combination of productive services alone 
or from the application of these services to raw materials. In order 
to take this circumstance into account, it is necessary to place the 
landowners, workers, and capitalists, who are sellers of services and 
buyers of consumable services and consumer goods, face to face with 


X Preface to the second edition

sellers of products and buyers of productive services and raw materi-
als. hose sellers and buyers are entrepreneurs, who seek a proit by 
transforming productive services into products; that is to say, into 
raw materials that they sell to one another, or into consumer goods 
that they sell to the landowners, workers, and capitalists from whom 
they have bought productive services. In this connection, to better 
understand these phenomena, instead of thinking of one market, we 
can suppose there are two: a market for services on which services 
are ofered exclusively by landowners, workers, and capitalists, and 
demanded as follows: the consumable services by the selfsame land-
owners, workers, and capitalists, and the productive services by the 
entrepreneurs; and a market for products on which these products 
are ofered exclusively by entrepreneurs, and demanded as follows: 
the raw materials, by the selfsame entrepreneurs, and consumer 
goods by landowners, workers, and capitalists. on the two markets, 
at prices cried at random, the landowners, workers, and capitalists, in 
their capacity as consumers, ofer services and demand consumable 
services and consumer goods in such a way as to obtain the largest 
possible sum total of utility, and the entrepreneurs, in their capacity 
as producers, ofer products and demand productive services or raw 
materials in the course of increasing their output in the case of an 
excess of the price of the product over the average cost resulting from 
the productive services involved in their production; and they reduce 
their output, on the other hand, in the case of the excess of the aver-
age cost resulting from the productive services used over the price 
of the product. on each market, prices are raised in the case of an 
excess of the demand over the supply and are lowered in the case of 
the excess of supply over demand. he current equilibrium prices are 
those at which the demand and the supply of each service or product 
are equal and at which, moreover, the price of each product is equal 
to the average cost resulting from the productive services used.
In order to pose the problem of capital formation, it must be sup-
posed that there are landowners, workers, and capitalists who save; 
that is to say, who, instead of demanding consumers’ goods and 
services equal to the total value of the services they ofer, demand 
new capital goods for part of that value. And, facing these creators of 
savings, it must be assumed that there are entrepreneurs who prod-
uce new capital goods in lieu of raw materials or consumers’ goods. 


THEORY OF SOCIAL WEALTH

PART I

OBJECT AND DIVISIONS OF 
ECONOMICS


3

LESSON 1

Adam Smith’s and J.-B. Say’s deinitions

SUMMARy: – Two-fold objective assigned to economics: 1o To 
provide the people with an income or an abundant level of living; 
2o To furnish the State or the community a suicient income. First 
observation. Two goals, equally important, but neither of which is 
the object of a proper science. here is another point of view for 
economics. Second observation. Two operations equally import-
ant, but of a diferent character, one a matter of economic advan-
tageousness and the other a matter of justice.
Economics envisaged as the simple exposition of the manner in 
which wealth is produced, distributed, and consumed. Naturalist 
point of view, permitting an easy refutation of socialism, but which 
is inaccurate if applied to the entire science. In regard to the pro-
duction and distribution of wealth, humans are led to choose one 
or another combination, not on the grounds of what is most nat-
ural, but on the grounds of what is most useful or most equitable.
1. he irst thing to be done at the beginning of a course or treatise 
on economics is to deine the science, its object, divisions, nature, 
and limits. I have no thought of evading this obligation; but I must 
warn that it is longer and more diicult to fulill than perhaps is 
supposed. We lack a deinition of economics. of all the deinitions 
that have been proposed, not one has met with the general deini-
tive acceptance that is the sign of truths acquired by science. I shall 
quote and criticize the most interesting of these deinitions, and I 
shall try to provide one. In the course of this task, I shall ind occa-
sion to mention certain names, titles of books, and dates that should 
be known.


4 Object and divisions of economics

2. Quesnay and his disciples are the irst important group of econ-
omists. hey have a common doctrine; they form a school. hey 
themselves call their doctrine Physiocracy; that is to say, the nat-
ural government of society; and that is why they are known today as 
Physiocrats. Apart from Quesnay, who wrote the Tableau économique 
(1758), the principal Physiocrats are Mercier de la Rivière, author 
of L’ordre naturel et essentiel des sociétés politiques (1767), Dupont 
de Nemours, author of Physiocratie ou constitution naturelle du gou-
vernement le plus avantageux au genre humain (1767–1768), the abbé 
Baudeau, and Le Trosne. Turgot is in a separate category. It can be 
seen from the titles of their works that the Physiocrats enlarged rather 
than narrowed the domain of the science. he theory of the natural 
government of society is not so much economics as it is social sci-
ence. he term Physiocracy therefore implies too wide a deinition.
3. Adam Smith in his Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth 
of Nations, published in 1776, was the irst to try, with remarkable 
success, to arrange the subjects of economics into an organized dis-
cipline. It was not, however, until the beginning of the introduction 
to Book IV of that work, a Book titled ‘of Systems of Economics’, 
that it occurred to him to provide a deinition of the science, and this 
is the one he gave: – ‘Economics,’ he said, ‘considered as a branch of 
the science of a statesman or legislator, proposes two distinct objects: 
irst, to provide a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people, or 
more properly to enable them to provide such a revenue or subsist-
ence for themselves; and secondly, to supply the state or common-
wealth with a revenue suicient for the public services. It proposes to 
enrich both the people and the sovereign.’ hat deinition, given by 
the person who has been called the father of economics, not at the 
beginning but towards the middle of his work, at a point at which he 
should have had a complete understanding of his subject, deserves 
careful consideration. It seems to me that it gives rise to two principal 
observations.
4. To provide a plentiful income for the people, to supply the State 
with a suicient income, is assuredly a very important double-facet-
ted goal, and if economics helps to achieve it, it renders us a signal 
service. But I do not see, however, that that constitutes the object of 


Adam Smith’s and J.-B. Say’s deinitions 5

a science properly speaking. Indeed the characteristic of a science 
properly speaking is the complete indiference to any consequences, 
advantageous or undesirable, of its attachment to the pursuit of pure 
truth. hus when the geometer enunciates that an equilateral triangle 
is at the same time equiangular, and when the astronomer enunciates 
that the planets move in an elliptical orbit of which the sun occupies 
one of the foci, they are doing science properly speaking. It is possible 
that the irst of these two truths, like the other truths of geometry, 
may lead to results that are valuable for carpentry, stone cutting, and 
every type of architecture or construction of houses; it is possible 
that the second truth and the entirety of astronomical truths may be 
of the greatest help to navigation; but neither the carpenter, nor the 
mason, nor the architect, nor the navigator, nor even those who work 
out the theories of carpentry, stone cutting, architecture, or naviga-
tion are scientists or do science in the true meaning of those words. 
Now, the two activities of which Adam Smith speaks are analogous, 
not to those of the geometer and the astronomer, but to those of the 
architect and the navigator. If, therefore, economics were what Adam 
Smith said, and if it were nothing else, it would certainly be a very 
interesting subject, but it would not be a science properly speaking. 
hus it must be stated that economics is something other than what 
Adam Smith says. Before thinking of providing a plentiful revenue 
for the people, and before concerning itself with furnishing the State 
with an adequate income, the economist pursues and grasps purely 
scientiic truths. hat is what he does when he states, for example, 
that the value of things tends to increase when the quantity demanded 
increases or when the quantity supplied decreases, and that this value 
tends to diminish in the two opposite cases; that the rate of interest 
falls in a progressive economy; that a tax levied on ground rent falls 
exclusively on the landowner without afecting the prices of agricul-
tural products. In all these cases, economists are doing pure science. 
Adam Smith himself did this. His disciples, Malthus and Ricardo, 
the former in his Essay on the Principles of Population (1798) and the 
latter in his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817), did 
even more. Adam Smith’s deinition is therefore incomplete in that it 
fails to mention the aim of economics considered as a science strictly 
speaking. To say, in efect, that the objective of economics is to pro-
vide a plentiful income for the people and to furnish the State with an 


6 Object and divisions of economics

adequate income is like saying that the object of geometry is to build 
solid houses, and that the aim of astronomy is to navigate the seas 
safely. It is, in a word, to deine a science in terms of its applications.
5. hat irst observation about Adam Smith’s deinition relates to the 
objective of the science; I have another, no less important, observa-
tion to make relative to its character.
To provide a plentiful income for the people and to furnish the State 
with a suicient income are two equally important, equally delicate 
operations, but having a very diferent character. he irst consists in 
providing agriculture, industry, and trade with various determinate 
conditions. According as these conditions are favorable or unfavor-
able, the agricultural, industrial, and commercial production will be 
plentiful or restricted. hus, in past times it has been seen that indus-
try sufered and stagnated under a regime of associations of artisans, 
guilds, regulations, and price ixing; it is seen today that under the 
opposite regime of freedom of work and of trade, industry grows 
and prospers. It was ‘so much the worse’ in the former case and ‘it is 
all the better’ in the second case; but, in each of them, it is only eco-
nomic advantageousness that is frustrated or favored; it is not justice 
that is attained or respected. Matters are quite otherwise when it is 
a question of supplying the State with suicient income. hat case 
is, in efect, an operation that consists in deducting from individual 
incomes the amount necessary to provide the income of the com-
munity. But, according to whether the conditions are good or bad, it 
happens not only that the income of the State is suicient or insuf-
icient, it happens in addition that individuals are treated equitably 
or inequitably; equitably if each contributes his share, inequitably if 
some are sacriiced while others are privileged. hus, there were for-
merly seen to be classes of society that were exempt from taxes that 
weighed exclusively on certain other classes. It is considered today 
that that was a lagrant injustice. hus, to obtain a plentiful income 
for the people is a useful activity, and to furnish the State with a suf-
icient income is an equitable activity. Usefulness and equity, eco-
nomic advantageousness and justice, are two very diferent orders of 
consideration, and it could be wished that A. Smith had made this 
diference clear by saying, for example, that the objective of econom-
ics is to indicate the conditions irst for the production of a plentiful 


Adam Smith’s and J.-B. Say’s deinitions 7

social income, and then for an equitable division of this income 
between individuals and the State. hat deinition would be better, 
but it would still leave out the truly scientiic part of economics.
6. Jean-Baptiste Say, who, in chronological order, is, ater Adam Smith, 
the most illustrious name in economics, said of his predecessor’s def-
inition: ‘I would rather say that the objective of economics is to make 
known the means by which wealth is produced, distributed, and con-
sumed.’ And, indeed, his work, the irst edition of which appeared in 
1803, while the second, banned by the Consulate censorship, could 
not be published until ater the fall of the First Empire, is titled Traité 
d’économie politique, ou simple exposition de la manière dont se for-
ment, se distribuent et se consomment les richesses. his deinition and 
the divisions that it establishes have been very generally approved 
and adopted by economists. It is surely those that one would be most 
tempted to consider as classic. But I ask permission not to side with 
that opinion, and to do so precisely on the grounds that have made 
them successful.
7. It is evident at irst glance that J.-B. Say’s deinition is not only 
diferent from Adam Smith’s, but that it is, in a certain sense, the 
complete opposite. While, if Adam Smith is to be believed, the whole 
of economics is an art rather than a science (§ 4), according to J.-B. 
Say, the whole of the science is a natural science. It seems, according 
to him, that the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth 
take place, if not completely independently, at least in a manner in 
some way independent of the human will, and that all of economics 
consists in a simple exposition of that manner.
What has seduced economists in this deinition is precisely the 
appearance of a natural science that it gives to the whole of econom-
ics. hat point of view, in fact, has singularly aided them in their 
ight against the socialists. Every plan of organization of work, every 
plan of organization of property was rejected by them a priori and, 
so to speak, without discussion, not as being contrary to economic 
advantageousness, nor as contrary to social justice, but simply as an 
artiicial scheme designed to replace a natural scheme. And what is 
more, this naturalistic viewpoint was borrowed from the Physiocrats 
by J.-B. Say and was inspired by the formula: Laissez faire, laissez 


8 Object and divisions of economics

passer that summarizes their doctrine in regard to industrial and 
commercial activity. hat is what earned the school of economists 
the epithet fatalistic given by Proudhon, and it is hard to believe, in 
fact, the point to which that school has pushed its consequences. It is 
necessary, in order to become aware of that, to read certain articles in 
the Dictionnaire de l’économie politique, such as Charles Coquelin’s 
‘Concurrence’, ‘Économie politique’ and ‘Industrie’, or Mr. Andre 
Cochut’s ‘Morale’; very meaningful passages are to be found in these 
articles.
Unfortunately, the indicated point of view is as false as it is con-
venient. If men were only a superior species of animal, were only 
bees undertaking instinctively their work and their habitual ways, 
it is certain that the exposition and explanation of social phenom-
ena in general, and of the phenomena of production, distribution, 
and consumption of wealth in particular, would be a natural sci-
ence that would not be, to speak accurately, other than a branch 
of natural history, the natural history of man following that of the 
bee. But matters are quite diferent. Man is a creature endowed with 
reason and freedom, capable of initiative and progress. In regard to 
the production and distribution of wealth, and generally in all mat-
ters of social organization, he has the choice between that which is 
good and that which is not, and increasingly turns from the latter to 
the former. hus man has progressed from a system of guilds, trade 
regulations, and price ixing to a system of liberty of industry and 
commerce, to the system of laisser faire and laisser passer, from slav-
ery to serfdom, from serfdom to the wage system. he more recent 
forms of organization are superior to the earlier forms not because 
they are more natural (both are artiicial, and the newer one even 
more so than the older ones, because they appeared only subsequent 
to them), but because they are more in conformity with economic 
advantageousness and justice. It is only ater a demonstration of this 
conformity that laisser faire, laisser aller must be adopted. And, if 
that can be demonstrated, it is on the grounds of being contrary 
to economic advantageousness and justice that socialist schemes 
should be rejected.
8. Inferior to Adam Smith’s deinition, which was only incomplete, 
J.-B. Say’s is therefore incorrect. I add that the divisions of the subject 


Adam Smith’s and J.-B. Say’s deinitions 9

that follow from Say’s deinition are completely empirical. he the-
ory of property and the theory of taxation, which are in reality only 
the two halves of the theory of the distribution of wealth among the 
people in human society, considered irst in isolation as individuals 
and then collectively as the State, and which are both dependent so 
essentially on moral principles, are separated and rejected, the irst, 
that of property, in the theory of production, and the other, that 
of taxation, in the theory of consumption, and are both elaborated 
exclusively from the economic point of view. he theory of value in 
exchange, which, on the contrary, has so clearly the character of a 
study of natural phenomena, is made part of the theory of distribu-
tion. It is true that his disciples interpret it as they please, using these 
arbitrary classiications, and, no less arbitrarily, some classify the the-
ory of value in exchange under the theory of production while others 
classify the theory of property under the theory of distribution. hat 
is the sort of economics that is done and taught today; but is it not 
justiied to say that in that sort of economics there are only broken 
structures, of which just the façade remains, and that, given the exist-
ence of such a state of afairs, the right and the duty of the economist 
is to formulate carefully the philosophy of the science?
9. he defect of J.-B. Say’s deinition has nevertheless been glimpsed 
by some of his students, but they have not remedied it. Adolphe 
Blanqui wrote:
In Germany and France, economists have strayed furthest from the true 
ield that today is generally assigned to economics. Some economists have 
attempted to make it a universal science; others have tried to restrict it to 
a narrow scope and popularized content. he struggle in France between 
these two extreme opinions turns upon the question whether economics 
should be considered as the statement of what is or as an agenda of what 
ought to be; that is to say, as a natural science or a moral science? We believe 
that it partakes of both characters.
It is in this way, an excellent means of condemning it, that Blanqui 
approves of J.-B. Say’s deinition.
Subsequent to Blanqui’s writings, Joseph Garnier wrote that
economics is both a natural and a moral science; from these two points of 
view, it sets forth that which is and that which ought to be according to the 
natural course of things and in conformity with the idea of justice.


10 Object and divisions of economics

Consequently, Garnier proposes a modiication of J.-B. Say’s dein-
ition by making a slight addition to it by saying that
economics is the science of wealth; that is to say, the science that has as its 
goal to determine how most rationally (naturally, equitably) wealth is and 
ought to be produced, exchanged, distributed, and used in the interest of 
individuals as well as in the interest of the whole society.
Garnier here makes a completely serious and truly praiseworthy 
efort to get out of the rut in which his school is stuck. It is strange, 
however, that he has not immediately recognized how the overlap-
ping amalgam that he proposes of two deinitions melded into one is 
bizarre and inconsistent. hat is a curious example of a lack of phil-
osophy that ofsets and nulliies, in French economists, so many of 
their intellectual qualities, the principal ones of which are clarity and 
precision. How could economics be simultaneously a natural science 
and a moral science? And what is one to make of such a science? 
on the one hand, there would be a moral science with the aim of 
determining how wealth ought to be most equitably distributed, and 
on the other hand, there would be a natural science with the aim of 
determining how wealth is most naturally produced. Moreover, the 
latter would advantageously be replaced by an art, that of the abun-
dant production of wealth. Taken all in all, J.-B. Say’s deinition leads 
us back, as can be seen, to Adam Smith’s (§ 5), and, in this entire 
afair, the true natural science still escapes us.
We shall undertake to seek it on our own account. We are going 
to separate, if necessary, economics into a natural science, a moral 
science, and an art. And to do so, as a preamble, we are going to dis-
tinguish between science, art, and ethics.

LESSON 2

Distinction between science, the arts,  
and ethics

SUMMARy: – he artsi advise, prescribe, direct; science observes, 
describes, explains. A diferent matter is the distinction between 
science and the arts; yet another matter is the distinction between 
theory and practice. he facts given by a science can throw light 
on several arts; an art can draw upon the information furnished by 
several sciences. hese distinctions are excellent but insuicient.
Science, the study of facts. First distinction: natural facts, having 
their origin in the play of the forces of nature; human facts, draw-
ing their source from the exercise of the will of man. Natural and 
human facts, the subjects of pure science (science properly speak-
ing and history). Second distinction: human industrial facts, or the 
relations among persons and things; human moral facts, or the 
relations among persons. Industrial facts, the subject of applied 
science or of the arts. Ethical facts, the subject of moral science or 
of ethics.
10. Several years ago Charles Coquelin, author of a quite good Traité 
du crédit et des banques, and one of the most active and esteemed 
collaborators on the Dictionnaire de l’économie politique,ii declared 
in the article Économie politique that economics still needed to be 
deined. In support of this assertion, he cited the deinitions of Adam 
Smith and J.-B. Say, to which I drew attention, and those of Sismondi, 
Storch, and Rossi, showing the diferences that distinguished one from 
another, declaring that a decided preference had not been shown for 
any of them, and even establishing that their authors had been the 
irst to fail to adhere to them in their own works. Charles Coquelin 
then very judiciously observes that before deining economics, it 


12 Object and divisions of economics

should be asked whether it is a science or an art, and if it is not at the 
same time both, and that, before doing anything else, it is advisable 
to distinguish an art and a science. he considerations he raises on 
this subject are strikingly accurate, and since the question is still in 
the state in which he let it, nothing better can be done other than to 
reproduce them:
An art (he says) consists…of a series of precepts or rules to be followed; 
a science consists of knowledge of certain phenomena or relationships 
observed or revealed…. An art advises, prescribes, directs; science observes, 
describes, explains. When an astronomer observes and describes the course 
of the stars, he is practicing science; but when, ater making his observa-
tions, he deduces from them rules applicable to navigation, he is practicing 
an art…. hus, to observe and describe real phenomena is science; to lay 
down precepts, prescribe rules, that is art.
11. In a footnote the author adds an observation that succeeds in 
clarifying the distinction and that equally deserves to be reproduced 
here.
he very real distinction (he says) that we have made between science and 
arts has nothing in common with the one that, rightly or wrongly, is made 
between theory and practice. here are theories of the arts, as there are of 
science, and it is even only of the former can it be said that they are some-
times in opposition to practice. Arts lay down the rules, but they are general 
rules, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that these rules, however sound, 
may be in conlict with practice in certain particular cases. But it is not the 
same with science, which demands nothing, which recommends nothing, 
which prescribes nothing, which limits itself to observing and explaining. In 
what sense could science ever come to ind itself in opposition to practice?
12. he arts and science having thus been distinguished, Coquelin 
indicates very clearly their respective roles and importance.
We are far (he says) from complaining or inding strange that men try 
to draw, from scientiic truths that have been observed and are properly 
deduced, rules that are applicable to the conduct of human afairs. It is not 
a good thing for scientiic truths to remain sterile, and the only way to use 
them is to deduce art from them. here are, we have already said, close rela-
tionships between science and the arts. Science lends its knowledge to the 
arts, it corrects its conduct, it clariies and directs its path; without the help 
of science, the arts would only be groping their way, stumbling at each step. 


Distinction between science, the arts, and ethics 13

on the other hand, it is the arts that make the truths that science has discov-
ered useful, and that, without the arts would remain sterile. It is also almost 
always the principal motive of the work of science. Mankind rarely studies 
solely for the pleasure of having knowledge; he has, in general, a goal of use-
fulness for his work, and this goal can only be achieved by the arts.
13. But he insists, nonetheless, that a distinction must be maintained 
between science and the arts, in support of which he makes a inal 
remark that is worthy of being mentioned.
It is all the more important (he says) to emphasize the distinction that we 
have just made, because if science and the arts oten have a great number 
of points of contact, it is far from being the case that their rays and their 
circumferences are identical. he information furnished by a science can 
sometimes be used by many diferent arts. For example, geometry, or the 
science of space relations, illuminates or directs the work of the surveyor, 
the engineer, the artilleryman, the navigator, the ship-builder, the architect, 
etc. Chemistry comes to the aid of the pharmacist, just as it does to the dyer 
and to many industrial occupations. Who can say how many diferent arts 
make proitable use of the general knowledge of physics? Conversely, an art 
can make use of the information furnished by several sciences; and it is in 
this way, just to cite one example, that medicine, or the art of healing, con-
sults the information contained in anatomy, physiology, chemistry, physics, 
botany, etc.
14. Charles Coquelin endeavors inally to make it understood how 
greatly the distinction between the arts and science would prove to 
have a felicitous and fruitful application in deining economics and 
in the classiication of economic subject matter, and he adds:
Will we attempt…, from now on, to efectuate a more precise separation 
between science and the arts by giving them diferent names? No; it suices 
for us to make the distinction clearly: time and a better understanding of 
the subject will do the rest.
hat decision is surprising. It is strange that a writer, ater having 
had such a sound idea, should thus deprive himself voluntarily of 
the pleasure and the honor that developing it would bring. But here 
is what is even more curious: whatever he may say, the author tries, 
in reality, to efectuate the separation between economic art and eco-
nomic science in specifying the true objective of economics, and in 
that efort succeeds so little that, confusing the elements of the arts 


14 Object and divisions of economics

for those of science as a consequence of a conception of the world of 
industrial facts too imprinted with the naturalistic and Physiocratic 
point of view, for which I criticized J.-B. Say (§ 7) and from which his 
students cannot free themselves, far from dissipating the confusion 
that he himself identiied, he even increases it. Certainly he does this 
when he wonders: Is it wealth that is the object of economic science, or 
industry, the source of wealth? and when he inquires how is it that the 
subject matter of the study of economics has been speciied to be wealth 
rather than human industry? and what have been the Consequences of 
this error; and inally when he declares that the deining Characteristic 
of economic science is that it is a branch of the natural history of man-
kind. It is impossible to go any further astray ater having taken the 
most detailed precautions against doing so.
15. his result would truly be such as to make it believed that the very 
idea of a distinction between the arts and science is not as appropri-
ate to the afair as it appears to be. And yet this distinction is perfectly 
applicable to economics. It suices to relect for a moment, once hav-
ing been alerted to the situation, to remain convinced, if we are free 
from partisan bias, that there is a theory of wealth; that is to say, of 
value in exchange, of exchange, a theory that is a science; and that 
there is a theory of the production of wealth, namely, a theory of 
agriculture, industry, and commerce, that is an art.iii However, it must 
be said immediately, if the distinction is valid, it is also incomplete 
because it does not take into account the distribution of wealth.
To convince ourselves of this immediately, let us recall Blanqui’s 
observation that economics can be considered both as an explanation 
of what is and as a program of what ought to be. Now, what ought to 
be, ought to be the case either from the point of view of utility or 
of economic advantageousness, or from the point of view of equity 
or of justice. What ought to be from the point of view of economic 
advantageousness is the concern of applied science or art; while what 
ought to be from the point of view of justice is the concern of moral 
science or ethics. It is evident that what, above all, concerns Blanqui 
and Garnier is what ought to be from the point of view of justice, 
since they speak of economics considered as a moral science, of the 
idea of right and justice, of the manner in which wealth should most 
equitably be distributed (§ 9). It is evident that, by contrast, this point 


Distinction between science, the arts, and ethics 15

of view escapes Coquelin, and that in pointing out the distinction 
to be made between the arts and science, he fails to point out that 
which is to be made between the arts and ethics. Very well! Let us, 
for our part, not neglect anything. Let us take up the whole question 
again, and make the distinction in a rational, complete, and deini-
tive manner.
16. We have to distinguish between science, the arts, and ethics. In 
other words, it is a question of sketching, necessarily very rapidly, 
the general philosophy of science in order to arrive at the particular 
philosophy of economics.
A truth long ago made clear by the Platonic philosophy is that 
science does not study bodies but the facts of which bodies are the 
theater. Bodies are temporary; facts endure. Facts, their relations and 
their laws, are the subject of all scientiic study. Moreover, sciences 
can difer because of their subject matter, or the facts they study. 
hus, in order to diferentiate the sciences, we must diferentiate the 
facts.
17. Now, irst, the facts that are to be found in the world can be con-
sidered of two sorts: those that result from the play of the forces of 
nature, which are blind and inevitable; the others have their source 
in the exercise of the human will, a force that is perceptive and free. 
Facts of the irst sort have nature for their theater and that is why we 
call them natural facts; facts of the second sort have humanity for 
their theater, and that is why we call them human facts. Alongside the 
many blind and inevitable forces, there is in the universe a force that 
is self-conscious and controls itself: it is the will of man. Perhaps this 
force does not know itself and does not have control of itself as com-
pletely as it supposes. hat is something that only the study of that 
force can discover. For the moment, it does not matter: the essential 
thing is that it knows itself and controls itself, at least within certain 
limits, and that makes a profound diference between the efects of 
that force and the efects of other forces. It is clear that, in regard to 
the efects of natural forces, nothing else can be done other than to 
recognize them, to describe them, to explain them, and then to guide 
them. hat is clear, because the natural forces are not conscious of 
their actions, and even less are they able to act in any other way than 


16 Object and divisions of economics

they do, and since the human will, on the contrary, is conscious of its 
acts and can act in several ways. he efects of the natural forces will 
therefore be the subject matter of what is called pure natural science 
or science properly speaking. he efects of the human will be the 
subject matter, irst, of a ield of study that will be called pure moral 
science or history, and, second, of a ield of study that will be called 
by some other name, be it the arts, be it ethics, as we will shortly see. 
hus, Charles Coquelin’s distinction between science and the arts (§ 
10) is justiied. An art ‘advises, prescribes, and directs’, because of 
the circumstances that it has as its subject matter the facts that have 
their source in the exercise of the will of man, and that the will of 
man being, at least up to a certain point, a force that is perceptive and 
free, there are grounds for advising it, for prescribing such and such 
conduct for it, for guiding it. Science ‘observes, describes, explains’, 
because of the circumstances that it deals with facts that have their 
origin in the play of natural forces, and that the natural forces being 
blind and inevitable, there is nothing else to do in regard to them 
other than to observe them and to describe them and to explain their 
efects.
18. We thus ind, not empirically as Coquelin did, but methodic-
ally through considering the perceptivenessiv and freedom of the 
human will, the distinction between science and the arts. he pre-
sent concern is to ind the distinction between the arts and eth-
ics. he same consideration of the perceptiveness and the freedom 
of the human will, or at least the consideration of a consequence 
of that fact, is going to furnish us the principle of that distinction 
through furnishing us the principle that divides human facts into 
two categories.
he fact of the perceptiveness and freedom of the human will 
divides all the beings in the universe into two great classes: persons 
and things. Any being that does not have self-awareness and control 
of itself is a thing. Any being that has self-awareness and control of 
itself is a person. Man has self-awareness; he has control of himself; 
he is a person. only man is a person; minerals, plants, animals are 
things.
he aims of things are rationally subordinate to the aims of per-
sons. A thing does not have awareness of itself, does not have control 


Distinction between science, the arts, and ethics 17

of itself, is not responsible for pursuing its aims, for the fulillment of 
its destiny. Equally incapable of vice and of virtue, it is always com-
pletely innocent; it can be likened to a pure mechanism. Matters are 
this way, in that regard, for animals as they are for minerals and vege-
tation: an animal’s instinct is no more than a blind and inevitable 
force, like all other natural forces. A person, on the other hand, just 
because he is conscious of himself and controls himself, is respon-
sible for fulilling his destiny; he will be meritorious if he achieves 
it, faulty in the contrary case. He has, therefore, unlimited faculties, 
unlimited latitude to subordinate the aims of things to his own aim. 
his faculty, this latitude, in all its length and breadth, is endowed 
with a particular character: it is a moral power, it is a right. his is the 
basis of the right of persons over things.
But while the aims of all things are under the dominion of the aims 
of all persons, on the other hand, no person’s aim is ever subordi-
nated to the aim of any other person. If there were only one man in 
the world, he would be master of everything. But that is not the case, 
and all those who are here, each being a person just like everyone, are 
equally responsible for the pursuit of their ends and for the pursuit of 
their aims, for the fulillment of their destiny. All these aims, all these 
destinies have to be coordinated with each other. hat is the origin of 
the reciprocity of rights and duties among persons.
19. In accordance with those considerations, it is seen that a funda-
mental distinction must be made between human facts. It is neces-
sary to distinguish, on the one hand, those that result from the will, 
from the activity of man acting in the realm of natural forces, other-
wise known as the relations between persons and things. And it is 
necessary to distinguish, on the other hand, those that result from 
the will, from the activity of man acting in the realm of the will, from 
the activity of other men, otherwise known as the relations among 
persons. he laws of these two classes of facts are essentially diferent. 
he objective of the human will acting in the realm of natural forces, 
the goal of the relations among persons and things, is the subordin-
ation of the aims of things to the aims of persons. he objective of the 
human will acting in the realm of the will of other men, the goal of 
the relations among persons, is the coordination with each other of 
the destinies of persons.


18 Object and divisions of economics

Marking, as is proper, this distinction by deining the phenom-
ena, I call the ensemble of facts of the irst category industry, and the 
ensemble of facts of the second category institutions. he theory of 
industry will be called applied science or art; the theory of institu-
tions will be called moral science or ethics.
In order, consequently, that a fact belong to the category of indus-
try, and that the theory of that fact be some art or another, it is neces-
sary and suicient that the fact, having its origin in the exercise of the 
human will, be a relationship between persons and things intended 
to subordinate the aims of things to the aims of persons. you can 
reconsider all the examples of the arts that have been cited and you 
will recognize that they all display that character. hus, architecture, 
shipbuilding, navigation, that have been mentioned, signalize wood 
and stone as materials used in the construction of houses, wood and 
iron for shipbuilding, hemp as the material used for rope-making, 
for the means of trimming sails, for setting them, and for maneuver-
ing them. he sea supports the vessels, the wind ills the sails, the 
skies and the stars point the way to the navigator.
And in order that a fact belong to the category of institutions, and 
in order that the theory of this phenomenon be a branch of ethics, it 
is necessary and suicient that this fact, having always its origin in 
the exercise of the human will, consist of relationships among persons 
intended to coordinate the destinies of the persons. So, for example, 
in regard to marriage or the family, it is ethics that determines the 
role and position of husband and wife, of parents and children.
20. Such, then, are science, the arts, and ethics. heir respective cri-
teria are truth, usefulness or economic advantageousness, and good-
ness or justice. Now, is there, in a comprehensive study of social 
wealth and of the facts related to it, the material for only one or for 
two of those kinds of intellectual investigations, or for all three? hat 
is what we shall see in the next lesson in the course of analyzing the 
idea of wealth.

Notes
i Walras uses the terms ‘the arts’ and ‘art’, in the context of this lesson, to refer 
to activities such as architecture, metallurgy, agronomy, sculpture, and the 
other examples given in sections 13 and 19 below.

however, he writes: ‘he theory of industry will be called applied science

iv Walras’s word ‘clairvoyance’ has the English equivalent with the same 
spelling. he primary meaning of ‘clairvoyance’ in English is ‘the power to 
perceive things that are out of the natural range of human senses’, like the 
knowledge of a medium or a gypsy fortune teller. he word ‘clairvoyant’ has 
a strong supernatural connotation to Anglophones. hat is also a special, 
psychological, meaning of the French word. he secondary meaning of the 
English word is: ‘Acute intuitive insight or acute perceptiveness’. Walras did 
not mean ‘acute intuitive insight’, which verges upon the paranormal dein-
ition. Moreover, ‘far-seeing’ is open to too many diferent interpretations. 
Walras did not use the word in those senses, so we should not translate 
the French ‘clairvoyant’ by the English ‘clairvoyant’. he primary and non-
paranormal meaning of ‘clairvoyance’ in French is: ‘Vue exacte, claire et 
lucide des choses; acuité, discernement, inesse, lair, lucidité, perspicac-
ité. Analyser la situation avec clairvoyance. Rien n’échappe à sa clairvoy-
ance’. Clairvoyant is deined as ‘Qui a de la clairvoyance. Esprit clairvoyant; 
in, intelligent, lucide, pénétrant, perspicace, sagace. D’un œil clairvoyant’ 
(Robert 2002, p. 449). he French to English dictionary translation of ‘clair-
voyance’ is: ‘of a person, clear-sightedness, perceptiveness; of the mind: 
perceptiveness’. In the light of the foregoing, it becomes clear that Walras’s 
‘clairvoyance’ should be translated as ‘perceptiveness’ or ‘discernment’.

LESSON 3

Social wealth. Triple consequences of 
scarcity. he fact of value in exchange and of 
economic theory

SUMMARy: – Social wealth, the totality of all scarce things; that 
is to say, 1o useful, and 2o limited in quantity. Scientiic rareté. only 
scarce things and all scarce things are 1o appropriable, 2o valu-
able and exchangeable, 3o producible industrially or multipliable. 
Economics: theory of value in exchange, theory of industry, the-
ory of property.
he fact of value in exchange. Brought about in the market. ‘he 
value of wheat is 24 francs per hectoliter.’ Natural fact. Mathematical 
fact. Equation 5vb = 600va . Value in exchange, a measurable mag-
nitude; theory of exchange and of value in exchange, or theory 
of social wealth, a physico-mathematical science. he rational 
method. he algebraic language.
21. By social wealth, I mean the totality of material or immaterial 
things (the materiality or immateriality of a thing does not in any 
respect matter here) that are scarce; that is to say that, on the one 
hand, are useful to us, and that, on the other hand, are available for 
our use only in limited quantity.
his deinition is important; I am going to make its terminology 
clear.
I say that things are useful whenever they can serve for any use, 
whenever they can be applied to any want and permit its satisfaction. 
It is therefore not necessary to be occupied here with the ine distinc-
tions by which utility is classiied, in ordinary conversation, along 
with what is agreeable and between what is necessary and what is 
superluous. Necessary, useful, agreeable, and superluous, all those 
conditions amount for us only to degrees of being more or less useful. 


Social wealth. Triple consequences of scarcity 21

Furthermore, neither is it necessary to take account here of the mor-
ality or immorality of any need to which a useful thing can be applied 
and that it can satisfy. Whether a substance is sought by a doctor to 
cure a sick person, or by a murderer to poison his family are very ser-
ious matters from some points of view, but a matter totally indifer-
ent from ours. To us, the substance is useful in both cases, and may 
even be more so in the latter case than in the former.
I say that things are available to us only in a limited quantity from 
the moment that they do not exist in a quantity such that each of us 
has enough of it available when it is wanted to satisfy fully the need 
that he has of it. here are a certain number of things in this world 
that, when they are not totally absent, are available to us in unlimited 
quantities. Such are atmospheric air, the light and heat of the sun 
when it is shining, the water in lakes and rivers, that exist in such 
quantities that no one need have an insuiciency of them, everyone 
taking as much as he wishes. hese things, that are useful, are gener-
ally not scarce and are not part of social wealth; in exceptional cases 
they can become scarce, and then they become part of that wealth.
22. It can be seen from that what the meaning here is of the words 
scarce and rareté.i It is a scientiic meaning like that of the word vel-
ocity in mechanics and heat in physics. For the mathematician and 
the physicist, velocity is not opposed to slowness, nor heat to cold, 
as is done in ordinary language: to the mathematician, slowness is 
only less speed; to the physicist, cold is only less heat. A body, in 
the language of science, has velocity as soon as it moves and heat as 
soon as it has any temperature. Similarly here, scarcity and abun-
dance are not in opposition to each other: however abundant it may 
be, a thing is scarce, in economics, the moment that it is useful and 
limited in quantity, exactly as a body has velocity, in mechanics, as 
soon as it moves a certain distance in a certain length of time. Does 
this mean that rareté is a ratio of utility to quantity, or the utility 
per unit of quantity, in the way that velocity is the ratio of distance 
traveled to the time taken to travel it, or the distance traveled per 
unit of time? his is a point on which we will not take a position at 
the moment, for we must come back to it later. Now, the fact that 
the limitation in the quantity of useful things makes them scarce has 
three consequences.


22 Object and divisions of economics

23. 1o Useful things limited in quantity are appropriable. Useless 
things are not appropriated: no one thinks of appropriating things 
that cannot serve any purpose. hings that are useful but that exist 
in unlimited quantities are also not appropriable. In the irst place, 
they are not controllable by force or seizable; much as one might like 
to take them out of the common domain, one cannot do so because 
of their quantity. And as for putting aside a small fraction of such 
a thing but leaving the greater part at the disposition of everyone, 
what would be the good of that? To extract a proit from it? But who 
would demand it, since everyone will always be able to have it freely? 
To use it oneself? But what good would it do to have a stock of it if 
one is sure of always having it at will? Why have a store of atmos-
pheric air (I mean in ordinary circumstances), since you will not 
have the occasion to give it to anyone and since you yourself, when 
you feel the need to breathe, have only to open your mouth to do 
so? Contrariwise, useful things that exist only in limited quantity are 
appropriable and appropriated. First, they are controllable by force or 
seizable: it is physically possible for a certain number of individuals 
to acquire the existing quantity of such a thing, to store it, to put it, 
so to speak, under lock and key, in such a way that none is let in the 
public domain. And there is, for these individuals, a double advan-
tage to doing that. In the irst place, they assure for themselves a pro-
vision of those things, they bring about the possibility of using them 
themselves, of applying them to the satisfaction of their own needs. 
In the second place, they reserve for themselves also the ability, if 
they are unwilling or unable to consume directly more than a part 
of their supply, to obtain for themselves, by exchange of the surplus, 
other utilities that are limited in quantity that they will consume 
instead of the original ones. But this leads us to a diferent fact. Let 
us limit ourselves to remarking, for the moment, that appropriation 
(and consequently property, that is appropriation that is legitimate 
or in conformity with justice) is applicable only to social wealth and 
applicable to all social wealth.
24. 2o Useful things limited in quantity are valuable and exchange-
able, as we have just briely noted. once scarce things have been 
appropriated (and only scarce things are, and all of them are) there 
is established among all these things a relationship consisting in 


Social wealth. Triple consequences of scarcity 23

the circumstance that, independently of their direct utility, each of 
them acquires, as a special property, the faculty of being exchange-
able against the others in such and such a determinate ratio. If a per-
son possesses any one of these scarce things, he can, by giving it up, 
obtain in exchange any other scarce thing that he lacks. If he does not 
possess it, he cannot obtain it except on the condition of giving up in 
exchange some other scarce thing that he possesses. And if he does 
not, and has nothing to give in exchange, he will be unable to obtain 
what he lacks. Such is the fact of value in exchange, that, like the fact 
of the appropriation of property, applies only to social wealth, and 
like that fact, applies to all social wealth.
25. 3o Useful things limited in quantity are industrially producible or 
multipliable. I mean by this that it is advantageous to produce them 
and to multiply their quantity as much as possible by means of regular 
and systematic eforts. here are, in the world, useless things (without 
speaking of those that are even harmful), such as weeds and animals 
that are of no use; we concern ourselves with them only to seek atten-
tively to discover in them some property that will make them pass 
from the category of useless things into the category of useful ones. 
here are useful things that are unlimited in quantity; we do well to 
concern ourselves with making use of them, but obviously not with 
increasing their quantity. Finally, there are useful things that are lim-
ited in quantity, scarce things; clearly, only the latter can be the subject 
of studies and activities having the goal of rendering their quantity 
less limited than it is, and clearly, furthermore, all of the latter can and 
must be the subject of such studies and such activities. herefore, if 
we call, as we have done, social wealth the totality of scarce things, we 
can also state that industrial production or industry, also applies only 
to social wealth and that it applies also to all social wealth.
26. Value in exchange, industry, and property are, then, the three gen-
eral facts, the three series or groups of particular facts that result from 
the limitation in quantity of useful things or the scarcity of things, 
the three facts that make up the whole of social wealth and of which 
only social wealth is the theater. Now we can appreciate how vague, 
imprecise, and unphilosophical, perhaps even wrong, it is to say, as, 
for example, did Rossi in starting his work on economics, that he 


24 Object and divisions of economics

was proposing to study social wealth. And, from what point of view 
would you study it? Is it from the point of view of value in exchange, 
that is, from the point of view of the phenomena of purchase and 
sale to which it is subject? Is it from the point of view of industrial 
production; that is to say, from the point of view of the conditions 
that favor or hinder the increase of its quantity? Is it from the point 
of view of property, the object of which is social wealth, that is to 
say, from the point of view of the conditions that render the appro-
priation of social wealth legitimate or illegitimate? We have to take 
a position. And above all, you must sedulously avoid studying these 
three points of view at the same time or any two of them simultan-
eously; for there is nothing more diferent from each other than they 
are, as will be seen.
27. We have seen a priori how scarce things, once appropriated, 
acquire value in exchange (§ 24). We need only to open our eyes to 
recognize a posteriori, among the class of general facts, the fact of 
exchange.
Given the way that we are constituted, we daily make, as a series 
of special acts, transactions; that is to say, sales and purchases. Some 
among us sell land or the use of land or the fruits of the land; some, 
houses, or the use of houses; some, industrial products or merchan-
dise that they have acquired wholesale and that they sell at retail; 
some, consultations, legal services, works of art, days or hours of 
labor. All, in return, receive money. With the money thus obtained, 
we buy at one moment bread, wine, and meat; at another, clothes; 
at another, shelter; at another, furniture, jewels, horses, carriages; at 
another, raw materials or labor; at another, merchandise; at another, 
houses, land; at another, stocks or bonds of various businesses.
he transactions are carried on in the market. he place where 
exchanges of a special kind are made is considered a special market. 
We say: the European market, the French market, the Parisian mar-
ket; Le Havre is a market for cotton, and Bordeaux is a market for 
wine; the covered central markets are markets for fruit and vegeta-
bles, for wheat and cereals; the stock exchange is a market for indus-
trial securities.
Let us consider the wheat market, and supposing that, at a given 
moment, we see that ive hectoliters of wheat are being exchanged for 


Social wealth. Triple consequences of scarcity 25

120 francs, or, for 600 grams of silver 0·900 ine, we say: ‘Wheat is worth 
24 francs a hectoliter.’ hat manifests the fact of value in exchange.
28. Wheat is worth 24 francs a hectoliter. We notice irst of all that 
this fact has the character of a natural fact. he value of wheat in sil-
ver, or this price of wheat, does not result from either the will of the 
buyer or the will of the seller, or from an agreement between the two. 
he seller would very much like to sell at a higher price; he cannot 
do so, because the wheat is not worth more, and because if he did 
not want to sell at that price, the buyer would ind close by a certain 
number of sellers willing to do so. he buyer would ask for noth-
ing better than to buy at a lower price; but he inds that impossible 
because the wheat is not worth less, and because, if he did not want to 
buy at this price, the seller would ind close by a certain number of 
buyers willing to agree to it.
he fact of value in exchange is therefore a natural fact, natural in 
its origin, natural in its manifestations and in its fundamental being. 
If wheat and silver have value, it is because they are scarce; that is to 
say, are useful and limited in quantity, two natural circumstances. 
And if wheat and silver have a particular value with respect to each 
other, it is because they are, respectively more or less scarce; that is 
to say, more or less useful and more or less limited in quantity, again 
two natural circumstances, the same as are mentioned above.
his does not mean that we have no inluence on prices. Because 
gravity is a natural fact and obeys natural laws, it does not follow that 
we can never do anything but watch its action. We can either resist 
it or let it operate freely, as we please, but we cannot change its char-
acter and its laws. We do not command it, as has been said, except 
in obeying it. It is the same with respect to value. In regard to wheat, 
for example, we could raise its price by destroying part of its supply; 
we could lower the price by eating, instead of wheat, rice, potatoes, 
or some other foodstuf. We could even decree that wheat will sell for 
20 francs instead of 24 francs a hectoliter. In the irst case, we would 
act upon the causes of the fact of value to substitute one natural value 
for another natural value. In the second case, we would act upon the 
fact itself by substituting an artiicial value for a natural one. But we 
could not prevent, in the one case or in the other, that, certain cir-
cumstances of supply and consumption being given, that, in a word, 


26 Object and divisions of economics

certain conditions of scarcity being given, they naturally result in or 
tend to result in a certain value.
29. Wheat is worth 24 francs a hectoliter. We notice now that this 
fact is mathematical in character as well. he value of wheat in terms 
of money, or the price of wheat, was 22 or 23 francs yesterday; not 
long ago it was 23 francs 50 centimes or 23 francs 75 centimes; in a 
little while it will be 24 francs 25 centimes or 24 francs 50 centimes; 
tomorrow it will be 25 or 26 francs; but today, and for the time being, 
it is 24 francs, neither more nor less. his fact has so clearly the char-
acter of a mathematical fact that I am immediately going to express it 
by an equation and thereby give it its true expression.
he hectoliter being taken as the unit of measure of the quantity of 
wheat, and the gram as the unit of measure of the quantiy of silver, we 
can state rigorously that, if 5 hectoliters of wheat are exchanged for 
600 grams of silver, it is true that ‘5 hectoliters of wheat are equivalent 
to 600 grams of silver’, or that ‘the value in exchange of 5 hectoliters of 
wheat equals the value in exchange of 600 grams of silver’, or inally, 
that ‘5 times the value in exchange of 1 hectoliter of wheat equals 600 
times the value in exchange of 1 gram of silver’.
Consequently, letting vb be the value in exchange of 1 hectoliter of 
wheat, and va be the value in exchange of 1 gram of silver 0·900 ine, 
we have the equation
5vb = 600va ,
or, dividing both sides of the equation by 5,
vb = 120va. [1]
If it is agreed, as we have assumed to be the case on the market that 
we have taken as an example, to choose as a unit of measure of value, 
not the value in exchange of 1 gram of silver, but the value in exchange 
of 5 grams of silver 0.900 ine, namely a franc; that is to say, if we set
5va = 1franc,
it follows that
vb = 24 francs [2]


Social wealth. Triple consequences of scarcity 27

But, in form [1] or in form [2] the equation is nonetheless, in 
either case, the exact translation of the following statement and, I will 
say, the scientiic expression of this fact: ‘Wheat is worth 24 francs a 
hectoliter’.
30. Value in exchange is thus a magnitude, and, we now see, is meas-
urable. And if the object of mathematics in general is to deal with 
magnitudes of this kind, it is certain that there is a branch of math-
ematics, forgotten thus far by mathematicians, and still undeveloped, 
namely the theory of exchange.
I do not say I have already stressed suiciently, that this science is 
the whole of economics. Forces and velocities are also measurable 
magnitudes, and the mathematical theory of forces and velocities 
is not the whole of mechanics. It is nevertheless certain that pure 
mechanics must precede applied mechanics. Similarly, there is eco-
nomic theory, which must precede applied economics, and economic 
theory is a physico-mathematical science. his assertion is new and 
will seem strange; but I have just proved it, and I will prove it even 
more convincingly in the following discussion.
If economic theory, or the theory of value in exchange and of 
exchange; that is, the theory of social wealth considered in itself, 
is a physico-mathematical science like mechanics or hydrodynam-
ics, it should not be afraid to employ the methods and language of 
mathematics.
he mathematical method is not an experimental method; it is the 
rational method. Do the natural sciences properly speaking restrict 
themselves purely and simply to describing nature and not go beyond 
experience? I leave it to the natural scientists the task of answering this 
question. What is sure, is that the physico-mathematical sciences, like 
the mathematical sciences properly speaking, do go beyond experi-
ence as soon as they have borrowed their type concepts from it. hey 
abstract from these real types ideal types that they deine, and on the 
basis of these deinitions they construct a priori the whole framework 
of their theorems and proofs. hey re-enter ater that into experience 
not to conirm but to apply their conclusions. Everyone knows per-
fectly well, no matter how little geometry they have studied, that the 
radii of a circumference are not equal to each other and that the sum 
of the three angles of a triangle is not equal to the sum of two right 


28 Object and divisions of economics

angles, except in an abstract and ideal circumference and triangle. 
Reality does not conirm these deinitions and proofs; it permits only 
a fruitful application of them. To follow this same method, economic 
theory must borrow from experience the real types of exchange, sup-
ply, demand, market, capital, income, productive services, products, 
etc. From these real types, economic theory must abstract ideal types 
by deining them, and conduct its reasoning on the latter, not return-
ing to reality until the science is completed, and with a view to prac-
tical applications. We will thus have, in an ideal market, ideal prices 
that will be in a rigorous relationship to ideal demand and supply. 
And so on. Will these pure truths have frequent applications? To be 
sure, it would be the right of the scholar to pursue science for its own 
sake, just as it is the right of the geometer (which, in fact, he exercises 
every day) to study the most singular properties of the most bizarre 
forms, if they are curious. But it will be seen that these truths of eco-
nomic theory furnish solutions of the most important, debated, and 
least clariied problems of applied and social economics.
As to language, why persist in using everyday language to express 
matters in a very diicult and very incorrect way, as Ricardo always 
does and as John Stuart Mill repeatedly does in his Principles of Political 
Economy, when matters can be stated in mathematical language in 
far fewer words and in a much more exact and clear fashion?

LESSON 4

he fact of industry and applied economics. 
he fact of property and social economics

SUMMARy: – he fact of industry. Direct utility; indirect util-
ity. Multiplication of utilities. Transformation of indirect utilities 
into direct utilities. Double sequence of industrial operations: l° 
technical operations, 2° economic operations resulting from the 
division of labor. he fact of industrial economic production, a 
human and not a natural fact; an industrial and not an ethical fact. 
heory of the production of social wealth, an applied science.
he fact of appropriation, a human and not a natural fact. 
Nature creates appropriability; men do the appropriation. An eth-
ical and not an industrial fact. Property, legitimate appropriation. 
Communism and individualism. heory of the distribution of 
social wealth, a moral science. he question of the relationships 
between ethics and economics.
31. only useful things that are limited in quantity can be produced 
by industry; they are all industrially producible (§ 25). And, in fact, 
it is certain that industry is undertaken only to produce scarce things 
and that it endeavors to produce all things that are scarce.
his fact of industrial production now needs to be described some-
what more precisely. Useful things that are limited in quantity, besides 
sufering from the drawback (for such it is) of this limitation, some-
times have another: that of not being of direct utility but only of an 
indirect utility. he leece of a sheep is unquestionably a useful thing, 
but before it can be applied to the satisfaction of a need, namely our 
need for clothing, it must undergo two preliminary industrial opera-
tions, one of which converts the wool into cloth, and the other of which 
converts the cloth into clothing. one has to relect only for a moment to 


30 Object and divisions of economics

convince oneself that the number of things that are limited in quantity 
that are useful but have only an indirect utility is very large. From that 
it follows that industrial production has a twofold aim: irst, to increase 
the number of useful things that do not exist in unlimited quantities, 
and, second, to transform indirect utilities into direct utilities.
his speciies clearly the object of industry that we initially deined 
in a very general fashion as the totality of relations between persons 
and things designed to subordinate the purposes of things to the 
purposes of persons. It is certain that man enters into relationships 
with all things in order to make use of them, but it is also certain that 
the constant aim of these contacts is the multiplication and trans-
formation of social wealth.
32. his twofold aim is pursued by human kind by means of two very 
distinct classes of operations.
1° he irst of these two classes of industrial operations is com-
posed of industrial operations properly speaking or technical 
operations. hus agriculture increases the number of plants and 
animals that are used for food and clothing; extractive industries 
increase the quantity of minerals that we use to make instruments 
and tools; manufacturing industries transform textile ibers into 
linen, woolen and cotton fabrics, and minerals into all kinds of 
machines; engineering industries construct factories, railways. 
Assuredly, these operations have the well deined character of 
relationships between persons and things, having the purpose 
of subordinating the purposes of things to the purposes of per-
sons, as well as the purpose, more circumscribed and more spe-
ciic, of multiplying and transforming social wealth. hey thus 
constitute a irst class of industrial facts forming the subject of a 
irst group of applied sciences or arts, namely the technical arts.
2° he second class of operations comprises those that are related 
to the economic organization of industry properly speaking.
In fact, the irst class of operations of which we have just spoken 
would constitute the whole of industry and would be the objective 
of all the arts, except that that completeness requires the essential 
fact that we encounter here, the fact of man’s physiological aptitude 
for the division of labor. If the destinies of all men were independent 


he fact of industry and applied economics 31

from the point of view of the satisfaction of their wants, each of us 
would have to pursue our objectives in isolation, by increasing, as he 
saw it, the quantity of useful things that do not exist in unlimited 
quantity and by transforming indirect utilities into direct utilities as 
it suited him. Each of us would have to be in turn his own plough-
man, spinner, baker, tailor. our condition would thus approach that 
of animals, because industry properly speaking, technical industry, 
would be insigniicant without the developments that it owes to the 
division of labor. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that this irst form of 
industry might still exist up to a point. But what could not exist to 
any degree would be, for example, economic industrial production.
Matters are not as we have just temporarily assumed. Not only 
does man possess a physiological aptitude for the division of labor, 
but, as we will see, this aptitude is the very condition of his existence 
and his subsistence. Instead of being independent, the destinies of 
all men are tied together from the point of view of the satisfaction of 
their wants. his, however, is not the place to examine the nature and 
origin of the division of labor; for the present, we are limiting our-
selves to noting the existence of this fact, just as we have noted the 
fact of the freedom and of the moral personality of mankind. he fact 
exists, and it consists in the circumstance that in place of multiplying 
scarce things by ourselves for our own use, of transforming indirect 
into direct utilities only to the extent to which we are individually 
concerned, we split up this task into specialized occupations. Some 
of us are ploughmen by specialty and nothing but ploughmen, others 
are spinners by specialty and nothing but spinners, and so forth. hat 
constitutes, we say, the division of labor. hat is a fact the existence of 
which springs into sight at a irst glance at the nature of society. And 
it is that fact alone that engenders industrial economic production.
33. Two problems result from that circumstance.
It is necessary, irst, that in the case of the division of labor, as is 
also true in the absence of the division of labor, industrial production 
of the social wealth must be not only abundant, but also properly 
proportioned. It is necessary to avoid producing too much of some 
scarce things while producing too little of others. It is also neces-
sary to avoid converting some indirect utilities into direct utilities 
on too large a scale while converting others in insuicient quantity. 


32 Object and divisions of economics

If each of us were simultaneously his own farmer, his own manufac-
turer, and his own engineer, he would engage in each trade to just 
the extent and in just such a manner as he saw it. But if the occupa-
tions are specialized, there must not be, for example, an abundance 
of manufacturers while there is an insuiciency of farmers, etc.
It is necessary, second, that, in the case of the division of labor, as is 
also true in its absence, the distribution of social wealth among men 
in the society be equitable. here should not be moral disorder any 
more than there should be economic disorder. If each of us produced 
everything that he consumes and consumed only what he produces, 
not only would he adjust his production to his consumption needs 
but his consumption would also be determined by the extent of his 
production. Well then! It must not be that, thanks to the specializa-
tion of occupations, some of us, who have produced little, consume a 
lot, while others, who have produced a great deal, consume little.
We understand that these two problems are important, and we 
also understand the direction taken by the various solutions that 
have been devised for them. he object of the guild system was, 
clearly, to provide for the condition of proper apportionment in pro-
duction. he system of freedom of industry and of commerce, or, as 
it is called, the system of laisser faire, laisser passer is claimed to have 
best harmonized the condition of proportionality with the condition 
of abundance. We will decide whether that is so. Before that system, 
those of slavery and serfdom had the obvious disadvantage of for-
cing some classes of the community to work for the beneit of other 
classes. our present system of property and taxation is claimed to 
have put a complete end to this exploitation of man by man. We will 
see if that is so.
34. As for the present, we have only one thing to do, and that is to 
recognize the two questions, and, ater having deined their object-
ive, to identify their character. It is absolutely impossible for us, 
whatever Charles Coquelin and the economists of his school may 
say, to attribute the character of a natural science to the question 
of the production of social wealth, any more than to the question 
of its distribution. he will of man is free to inluence the produc-
tion as well as the distribution of social wealth, with the qualiica-
tion that in the second case, the will of man should be guided by 


he fact of industry and applied economics 33

considerations of justice, and in the irst case, it should be guided by 
considerations of economic advantageousness. Moreover, technical 
production and economic production, as we have deined them, are 
not unlike in essence. here is, in fact, no diference of fundamen-
tal nature between the fact of industrial technique and the fact of 
economic production that we have deined. he two facts support 
each other and are interconnected, each being complementary to the 
other. hey are both human facts and not natural facts; they are both, 
moreover, industrial and not ethical facts, because they both consist 
of relationships among persons and things in order to subordinate 
the purposes of things to the purposes of persons.
he theory of the economic production of social wealth, that is, of 
the organization of industry under the division of labor, is therefore 
an applied science. hat is why we will call it applied economics.
35. We have seen that only useful things limited in quantity are 
appropriable, and that they are all appropriable (§ 23). We have only 
to look around us to recognize that these things are the only ones that 
are appropriated and that they are all appropriated. Useless things are 
disregarded; things that are useful but unlimited in quantity are also 
relegated to the common domain; but scarce things are taken out 
of the common domain and are no longer at the disposition of the 
irst-comer.
he appropriation of scarce things or of social wealth is a human 
fact and not a natural fact: it has its origin in the exercise of the human 
will and in human activity and not in the activity of natural forces.
Without a doubt, it does not depend on us that useful things unlim-
ited in quantity are appropriable; it does not depend on us that useful 
things limited in quantity are not appropriable. But once the natural 
conditions of appropriation are fulilled, it depends on us that the 
appropriation be made in one way rather than in another. obviously, 
that does not depend on each of us individually but on all of us taken 
collectively. It is a human fact that has its origin not in the individual 
will of each man, but in the collective activity of society as a whole. In 
fact, human initiative has always acted, still acts, and will always act 
upon the fact of appropriation to modify it to suit its own purpose. 
In early societies, the appropriation of things by persons in a system 
of division of labor, otherwise known as the distribution of social 


34 Object and divisions of economics

wealth among men in society, was efectuated by force, cunning, and 
luck, although not, however, in ways totally outside of rational condi-
tions. he boldest, the strongest, the cleverest, the luckiest obtained 
the majority, the others had what was let over, that is, nothing or 
very little. But in regard to property as in regard to the government, 
the human race has always patiently progressed from the initial dis-
order of facts towards the ultimate order of principles. To summarize, 
nature creates only appropriability; humans do the appropriation.
36. he appropriation of things by persons or the distribution of 
social wealth among men in society is, furthermore, an ethical and 
not an industrial fact. It is a person-to-person relationship.
Most certainly, we enter into a relationship with scarce things in 
order to appropriate them, and oten we succeed in achieving the 
appropriation only ater long and persistent eforts. But this point of 
view, which is the one of which we have just spoken, is no longer the 
one that occupies us at present. For the time being, we will consider 
the fact of the distribution of social wealth in itself and independ-
ently of both preparatory circumstances and natural conditions. I 
explain myself by an example.
I assume there is a tribe of savages and a deer in a forest. he deer is 
a useful thing limited in quantity and hence subject to appropriation. 
his point once having been made, nothing more needs to be said 
about it. Moreover, before the deer can be appropriated in the proper 
sense, it has to be hunted and killed. Neither do I consider the second 
side of the question, namely the point of view of the hunt that is to 
be studied at the same time as the necessity of dressing the deer and 
cooking it or the point of view of cookery. Abstraction made from 
these aspects of man’s relation to the deer, there is another question 
that arises, namely that of knowing, when the deer is still in the for-
est, or when it is dead, who will own it. It is the fact of appropriation 
thus envisaged that is of concern, and it is the fact of appropriation 
thus envisaged that constitutes a relationship of persons to persons. 
We need only take one step further into the question to convince 
ourselves of this. ‘It will be owned’, says one of the young and active 
members of the tribe, ‘by the person who kills it. If you are too lazy 
or if your aim is not good enough, so much the worse for you!’ An 
older, weaker member replies: ‘No! he deer belongs to all of us to be 


he fact of industry and applied economics 35

shared equally. If there is only one deer in the forest, and you happen 
to be the irst to catch sight of it, that is no reason why the rest of us 
should go without food.’ he fact is essentially moral, as can be seen, 
and is a question of justice or of the coordination of the destinies of 
persons.
37. hus the mode of appropriation depends on our decisions, and 
according to whether those decisions are good or bad, the mode of 
appropriation will be good or bad. If good, it will have coordinated 
destinies among persons; it will have satisied justice; if bad, it will 
have subordinated the destinies of some persons to the destinies of 
others; it will have sanctioned injustice. What mode of appropriation 
is good and just? What mode of appropriation is recommended by 
reason of its being compatible with the requirements of the moral 
personality? hat is the problem of property. Property is equitable 
and rational appropriation, legitimate appropriation. Appropriation 
is a fact pure and simple; property is a legitimate fact and a right. 
Between the fact and the right, there is the place for ethical theory. 
his is an essential point and one that must not be misunderstood. To 
ind fault with the natural conditions of appropriation, to ennumer-
ate the diferent ways in which men have distributed social wealth in 
all places and at all times, that is nothing. To criticize all these various 
systems of distribution from the standpoint of justice that derives 
from the moral personality of man, from the point of view of equality 
and inequality; to say in what respects they were always defective and 
still are, to indicate the only good system, that is everything.
38. Ever since there has been social wealth and humans in societies, 
the question of the distribution of social wealth among men in society 
has been debated. It has always been debated on these grounds, which 
are the true ones, and on which it should continue to be debated. 
Among all the systems of distribution that have been developed, there 
are two that are renowned, that have had for their champions the two 
greatest minds of antiquity, Plato and Aristotle: they are communism 
and individualism. Now, what do these systems say? - ‘Goods,’ com-
munism says, ‘ought to be appropriated collectively. Nature has given 
them to all men, and not only to those that exist today, but also to 
those who will exist in the future. To divide them among individuals 


36 Object and divisions of economics

is to alienate the patrimony of the community and of future genera-
tions; it is to expose those born ater this division to inding them-
selves robbed of the resources that Providence had prepared for them; 
it is to hinder their pursuit of their goals and the fulillment of their 
destiny.’ - ‘he goods’, individualism replies, ‘should be appropriated 
individually. Nature has made men unequal in virtue and talent. To 
compel those who are industrious, who are capable, who are thrity to 
make available for common use the fruits of their labor and of their 
saving is to rob them for the beneit of those who are lazy, incom-
petent, and wasteful; it is to relieve all men of responsibility for the 
pursuit, whether good or bad, of their goals and for the fulillment, 
whether moral or immoral, of their destinies.’ I stop there. Which is 
right, communism or individualism? Are they not both wrong and 
right at the same time? We do not need to decide this diference of 
opinion here, and I do not want to add anything, for the moment, 
whether it be a judgment or only a more developed exposition of 
these doctrines. I only wanted to make clear what exactly the problem 
of property is considered in the broadest and most complete manner. 
Now, this object consists essentially in establishing the relations of 
persons to persons in regard to the appropriation of social wealth in 
view of the coordination of the destinies of persons in relation to each 
other, in conformity with reason and justice. he fact of appropri-
ation is therefore essentially an ethical fact; the theory of property is 
therefore essentially an ethical science. Jus est suum cuique tribuere-
justice consists in rendering to each that which is due to him; if ever 
a science has had the objective of rendering to each that which is due 
to him, if ever a science consequently has had justice as its objective, 
it is surely that of the distribution of social wealth, or, as we will call 
it, social economics.
39. here is, however, a diiculty here that I do not want to conceal.
he theory of property ixes and determines the relations between 
men considered as moral persons in regard to the appropriation of 
social wealth, or the conditions of the equitable distribution of social 
wealth among men in society. he theory of industry ixes and deter-
mines those relations between things and men considered as work-
ers devoted to specialized occupations, relations having the purpose 
of increasing and transforming social wealth, or, the conditions of 


he fact of industry and applied economics 37

an abundant production of social wealth among men in society. he 
irst conditions are ethical conditions that will be deduced from the 
point of view of justice. he others are economic conditions that will 
be deduced from the point of view of economic advantageousness. 
But they are both social conditions, prescriptions for the organiza-
tion of society. Now, will these two orders of consideration be in con-
lict with each other, or will they lend themselves to being mutually 
supportive? If, for example, the theory of property and the theory of 
industry both repudiate slavery or communism, that will be well; but 
assume that while one of these theories prohibits slavery or advocates 
communism in the name of justice, the other advocates slavery or 
prohibits communism in the name of economic advantageousness, 
there would be disagreement and a contradiction between ethical 
science and applied science. Is such a contradiction possible, and, if 
it arises, what should be done about it?
We will meet this problem again and give it the attention it merits. 
It is the question of the relation of ethics to economics that was vig-
orously debated by Proudhon and Bastiat around 1848. Proudhon, 
in his Contradictions économiques, argued that there is a conlict 
between justice and economic advantageousness. Bastiat, in his 
Harmonies économiques, maintained the opposite thesis. I think, for 
my part, that neither proved his point, and I will take up Bastiat’s 
thesis and defend it in a diferent way. However that may be, if the 
question exists, it must be solved, and not suppressed by confusing 
two distinct sciences with each other: the theory of property, which 
is an ethical science, and the theory of industry, which is an applied 
science.

tions. A market, a place where exchanges are made. Analysis of the

he increase or the decrease of the price causes the demand to decrease 
or increase. What about the supply?
40. In our general preliminary considerations (§ 21), we deined 
social wealth as the totality of all things, material or immaterial, that 
are scarce; that is to say, that are both useful and limited in quan-
tity, and we have shown that all scarce things and only such things 
have value and are exchangeable. Here we will proceed otherwise. 
We will deine social wealth as being the totality of all things, material 
or immaterial, that are valuable and exchangeable, and we will show 


42 heory of exchange

that all valuable and exchangeable things, and only those things, are 
useful and at the same time limited in quantity. We went, in the irst 
case, from cause to efect; we will go, in the second case, from efect 
to cause. It is clear that, provided we establish the linkage between 
the two facts of scarcity and value in exchange, we are free to pro-
ceed as we wish. Now, I think that in a methodical study of any gen-
eral fact like value in exchange, the examination of its nature should 
precede a search for its origin.
41. Value in exchange is the property certain things have of not being 
obtained or given up freely, but of being bought and sold, received and 
given up in return for other things in certain quantitative propor-
tions. he buyer of a thing is the seller of what he gives in exchange. 
he seller of a thing is the buyer of what he receives in exchange for 
it. In other words, every exchange of two things, one for the other, is 
composed of a double purchase and a double sale.
hings that are valuable and exchangeable are also called commod-
ities. he market is a place where commodities are exchanged. he 
fact of value in exchange occurs in the market, and so it is to the mar-
ket that we must go to study value in exchange.
Value in exchange let to itself occurs naturally in the mar-
ket under the regime of competition. As buyers, the traders make 
ofers to buy at higher prices; as sellers, they make ofers to sell at 
lower prices, and their competition thus leads to a certain value in 
exchange that is sometimes rising, sometimes falling, sometimes 
stationary. Depending upon whether the competition functions 
more or less well, the value in exchange is determined in a more or 
less precise manner. he markets that are best organized in regard to 
competition are those in which purchases and sales are made by the 
crying out of prices, through the intermediation of agents such as 
loor traders, commercial agents, criers, who centralize transactions 
in such a way that no transaction takes place without the conditions 
being announced and known and without the sellers being able to 
lower their prices and buyers to raise them. his is the manner of 
functioning of stock exchanges, commercial markets, grain markets, 
ish markets, etc. Alongside these markets, there are others in which 
competition, although less well organized, nevertheless functions in 
a fairly efective and satisfactory manner; examples are the markets 


he market and competition 43

for fruits and vegetables, for fowl. he streets of a town in which 
there are stores, and the shops of bakers, butchers, grocers, tailors, 
shoemakers, are markets in which competition is somewhat more 
defective, but where, however, it makes itself very adequately felt. It 
is similarly incontestable that competition presides in the determin-
ation of the value of doctors’ and lawyers’ consultations, of musi-
cians’ and singers’ recitals, etc. In short, the world can be considered 
as a vast general market composed of various special markets in 
which social wealth is sold and bought, and our concern is to rec-
ognize the laws according to which these sales and purchases tend 
to be made of their own accord. In that endeavor, we will always 
assume a market perfectly organized under the regime of competi-
tion, just as in pure mechanics we initially assume that machines are 
frictionless.
42. Let us therefore see how competition works in a well-organized 
market, and to do so, let us go into the stock exchange of a large cap-
ital market like Paris or London. What is bought and sold, in such 
places, are parts of certain very important kinds of social wealth rep-
resented by their certiicates: fractions of State and municipal loans, 
shares of railways, canals, metals factories, etc. At irst, upon entering 
such an exchange, we hear only a confused clamor, we are aware only 
of chaotic movement; but, once we are informed of what is happen-
ing, the noise and activity are perfectly explained.
Let us take, for example, the trading activities in 3% French gov-
ernment bonds on the Paris Bourse,ii separating them from all other 
operations.
he three per cent is, as is said in market terminology, quoted at 
60 francs. Agents who have received some orders to sell at 60 francs 
or less ofer a certain quantity of 3 per cent government bonds, that 
is, a certain number of bonds each yielding 3 francs annually payable 
by the French State, at a price of 60 francs. We will call an ofer made 
in that way of a deinite amount of a commodity at a deinite price 
an efective supply. on the other hand, the agents who have received 
orders to buy at 60 francs or more will demand a certain quantity 
of 3% government bonds at a price of 60 francs. We will call that 
demand for a certain amount of a commodity at a certain price an 
efective demand.


44 heory of exchange

We now have to make three suppositions in accordance with 
whether the demand is equal to, greater than, or less than the supply.
First Hypothesis. he quantity demanded at 60 francs is equal to 
the quantity ofered at that price. Each agent, on either the buying 
or the selling side, inds exactly his counterpart in another agent 
who is a buyer or a seller. Exchange takes place. he price of 60 
francs is maintained; there is a stationary state or equilibrium of the 
market.
Second Hypothesis. he agents with orders to buy no longer 
ind their counterpart, which proves that the quantity of 3% bonds 
demanded at a price of 60 francs is greater than the quantity ofered 
at that price. heoretically, trading must be suspended. hose among 
them who have orders to buy at 60 francs 5 centimes or more will be 
demanders at that price. hey raise the price.
Two results follow from that increase: irst, buyers at 60 francs, 
who are no longer buyers at 60 francs 5 centimes, withdraw; second, 
sellers at 60 francs 5 centimes, who were not sellers at 60 francs, 
come forward. hese buyers and sellers submit their orders if they 
have not already done so. hus, for a twofold reason, the diference 
between efective demand and efective supply is reduced. If the 
equality is restored, the rise in price stops at that level; otherwise, the 
price continues to go up from 60 francs 5 centimes to 60 francs 10 
centimes, and from 60 francs 10 centimes to 60 francs 15 centimes, 
until equality of supply and demand is reestablished. here is then a 
new stationary state at a higher price.
hird Hypothesis. Agents with orders to sell can no longer ind 
their counterpart, which indicates that the quantity of 3% bonds 
ofered at a price of 60 francs is greater than the quantity demanded 
at that price. Trading is suspended. hose among them who have 
orders to sell at 59 francs 95 centimes or less make ofers at that price. 
hey lower the price.
Two results follow: irst, the withdrawal of sellers at 60 francs 
who are no longer sellers at 59 francs 95 centimes; second, the com-
ing forward of buyers at 59 francs 95 centimes who were no longer 
buyers at 60 francs. Reduction of the diference between supply and 
demand. he price falls, if necessary, from 59 francs 95 centimes to 
59 francs 90 centimes, and from 59 francs 90 centimes to 59 francs  


he market and competition 45

85 centimes, until equality between supply and demand is restored. 
At that time, a new equilibrium is found at a lower price.
Suppose that the same operation that is made in that way in the 
market for 3% French government bonds is made at the same time in 
the markets for the bonds of all countries: English, Italian, Spanish, 
Turkish, Egyptian; for the stocks and bonds issued by railways, ports, 
canals, mines, gas works, other factories, banks, credit institutions, 
by conventional variations of 5 centimes, 25 centimes, 1 franc 25 cen-
times, 5 francs, 25 francs, according to the value of the securities; and 
suppose that besides operations of sale and purchase on cash terms, 
there are operations of sale and purchase of futures, some irm and 
others optional, then the tumult of the Bourse becomes a veritable 
concert in which everyone plays his part.
43. We are going to study value in exchange that occurs under the 
indicated competitive conditions. Economists have, generally speak-
ing, been wrong to consider it much too exclusively as it takes place 
in exceptional circumstances. hey talk to us always only about dia-
monds, Raphael’s paintings, and recitals given by fashionable tenors 
and sopranos. A certain Mr. De Quincey, quoted by John Stuart Mill, 
assumes that two individuals are crossing Lake Superior in a steam 
boat. one owns a music box; the other, who is ‘making his way to an 
uninhabited region 800 miles from civilization’, suddenly realizes that 
in leaving London he forgot to buy one of those instruments that have 
‘the magic power of calming the agitations of his soul’; and he buys 
the music box from the irst individual at the last possible moment 
that a sale can be made, at a price of 60 guineas. of course, the theory 
should take account of all these special cases; the general laws of the 
market should apply to the diamond market, the market for Raphael’s 
paintings, and to the market for tenors and sopranos. hey should 
even apply to a market, that, like the one Mr. De Quincey imagines, is 
constituted of a single buyer, of a single seller, and of a single item, and 
in which there is only one minute in which to make the exchange. But 
sound logic demands that we consider general before special cases, 
and not the special case before the general case, as would be done by a 
physicist who, in order to observe the sun, carefully chooses an over-
cast time instead of taking advantage of a cloudless sky.


46 heory of exchange

44. To give a preliminary idea of the fact of exchange and the mech-
anism of competition, I have taken the example of buying and selling 
securities for gold and silver on the Bourse. But those securities are 
a very special kind of commodity, and the intervention of money in 
trading is also a special fact, the study of which will be postponed 
until later, and not interwoven, at the outset, with the general fact 
of value in exchange. Let us, therefore, retrace our steps, and, to give 
our observations a scientiic character, let us take any two commod-
ities, say oats and wheat, or, designate them even more abstractly as 
(A) and (B).iii I put the letters A and B in parentheses in order not to 
lose sight of the fact that they do not represent quantities, which are 
the only category of things susceptible of being used in equations, 
but instead represent kinds, species, or, as would be said in philo-
sophical terms, essences.
Let us now imagine a market on one side of which some people 
arrive holding the commodity (A), and who would like to exchange 
part of it in order to procure commodity (B); and on the other side 
people who have the commodity (B) and would like to give up some 
of it in order to procure commodity (A). Since there must be an ini-
tial basis for the bidding, we shall suppose that an agent ofers to give 
up n units of (B) for m units of (A) in accordance with, for example, 
the closing rate of exchange on the preceding day, and in accordance 
with the equation of exchange
mva =nvb
in which va is the value in exchange of one unit of (A) and vb is the 
value in exchange of one unit of (B), using the notation already indi-
cated (§ 29).
In naming in general the ratios between values in exchange prices, 
or the relative values in exchange, in designating in general by pb the 
price of (B) in terms of (A), and by pa the price of (A) in terms of (B), 
and in designating, in the present case, by µ and 1/ µ the quotients 
of the ratios m
n 

and n

, we obtain from the irst equation

hus: – Prices, or ratios of values, are equal to the inverse ratios of the 
quantities exchanged.
hey are reciprocals of each other.
If (A) is oats and (B) is wheat, and an agent ofered to exchange  
5 hectoliters of wheat for 10 hectoliters of oats, then the price pro-
posed for wheat in terms of oats would be 2, and that of oats in terms 
of wheat would be 1/2. Similarly, there is always a double sale and a 
double purchase in every transaction, just as there is also always a 
double price. hat invariable reciprocity is the most important cir-
cumstance that must be recognized in the fact of exchange, and the 
employment of algebraic symbols is above all invaluable because it 
displays that condition as clearly as possible. It has also the merit, as 
is seen, of permitting a clear and precise formulation of general prop-
ositions. hat is why we will continue to use them.

45. Let Da , Oa, Db, and Ob be the efective demand for and sup-
ply of commodities (A) and (B) at their respective prices pa =
µ

1 

 

and pb =µ. here is an essential relationship between the quan-
tities demanded and supplied and prices that must be indicated irst 
of all.
Efective demand and efective supply are, as we have seen, the 
demand and the supply of a given quantity of a commodity at a given 
price. Consequently, to say that a quantity Da of (A) is demanded 
at the price pa is, ipso facto, to say that a quantity Ob of (B) equal 
to Da pa , is being ofered. hus, to say, for example, that there is a 
demand for 200 hectoliters of oats at the price 1/2 in terms of wheat 
is to say that there is a supply of 100 hectoliters of wheat. In general, 
therefore, there is, between Da , pa and Ob , the equation


48 heory of exchange
Ob =Da pa .
Similarly, to say that a quantity Oa of (A) is ofered at the price pa 
is, ipso facto, to say that a quantity Db of (B), equal to Oa pa is being 
demanded. hus, to say, for example, that 150 hectoliters of oats are 
being ofered at the price of 1/2 in terms of wheat is to say that 75 
hectoliters of wheat are demanded. In general, therefore, there is, 
between Oa , pa and Db , the equation
Db =Oa pa
It could be proved, similarly, that there are, between 
Db ,Ob , pb ,Oa and Da , the equations:
Oa =Db pb
Da =Ob pb ,
if it were not that the proof would be redundant because these two 
equations result from the two previous ones together with the equa-
tion pa pb =1.
hus: – he efective demand for or supply of one commodity in 
exchange for another is equal to the efective supply of or demand for 
the second commodity multiplied by its price in terms of the irst.
It can be seen that two of the four quantities Da ,Oa ,Db and Ob will 
determine the other two. We will assume until further notice that it is 
the quantities supplied, Ob and Oa, that are determined by the quan-
tities demanded, Da and Db, and not that the quantities demanded 
result from the quantities supplied. Indeed, when two commodities 
are exchanged for each other in kind, demand ought to be consid-
ered as the principal fact, and supply as an accessory fact. We do 
not supply goods just in order to supply; we only supply because we 
cannot demand goods without supplying some; supply is only a con-
sequence of demand. We will therefore content ourselves with the 
indirect relationship between supply and price, and not seek for a 
direct relationship except between demand and price. At prices pa 
and pb , the demands are Da and Db, from which result the supplies 
Oa =Db pb and Ob =Da pa .


he market and competition 49

46. hat having been said, letting
Da =αOa
we have three hypotheses to make according to whether we have α = 1,  
α > 1, or α < 1. But, let us irst state one last theorem.
If we substitute in the above equation the two values of Da and Oa 
given by the equations
Da =Ob pb
Oa =Db pb
there results
Ob =αDb
hus: – Given two commodities, the ratio of the efective demand 
of either one of them to its efective supply is equal to the ratio of the 
efective supply of the other to its efective demand.
his theorem may be deduced as follows:
Da =Ob pb
Db =Oa pa
Da Db =OaOb
or, similarly,
Oa =Db pb
Ob =Da pa
OaOb =Da Db
so that we have, in either way,

We know, therefore, that if the efective demand for and efective 
supply of (A) are equal, the efective supply of and efective demand 
for (B) will also be equal; that if the efective demand for (A) is 
greater than its efective supply, then the efective supply of (B) will 
be proportionately greater than its efective demand; that, inally, if 
the efective supply of (A) is greater than its efective demand, then 
the efective demand for (B) will be proportionately greater than its 
efective supply. hat is the meaning of the above-stated theorem.
47. Now assume that α =1,Da =Oa , and Ob =Db , the quantities 
demanded and supplied of the two commodities (A) and (B) at their 
respective prices pa = 1

µ and pb =µ are equal: each buyer or seller 
inding his exact counterpart in a seller or buyer. he market is in 
equilibrium. At the equilibrium prices 1
µ

 and µ, the quantity Da =Oa 
of (A) is exchanged for the quantity Ob =Db of (B), and, the mar-
ket day having ended, the owners of the two commodities go their 
own way.
48. But assume that α 1,Da Oa ,and Ob  Db.
he irst idea that occurs is to repeat purely and simply the rea-
soning that we followed about the stock exchange in regard to gov-
ernment bonds. hat would be a very serious error. In the stock 
exchange, we had buyers and sellers of government bonds, that is, of 
securities the value of which depend both on their particular yield 
and on the general rate of return on capital. As we will see later, a rise 
in the price of government bonds can only decrease the demand for 
them and increase their supply; a fall could only increase the demand 
for them and decrease their supply. Here, we have traders of (A) and 
(B) that we assume to be two commodities that are of direct util-
ity and are the only commodities on the market. hat circumstance 
alters everything.
Unquestionably, it will always be necessary to raise pa (or lower pb), 
if Da is greater than Oa, or, contrariwise, to raise pb (or lower pa) if 
Db is greater than Ob. here is also no doubt, in regard to demand, 
that our previous reasoning is correct. When the price increases, 


he market and competition 51

the demand cannot increase; it can only decrease. And when the 
price decreases, the demand cannot decrease, it can only increase. 
hus, a rise in pa , which will be a fall in pb, can only decrease Da and 
increase Db ; on the other hand, a rise in pb, which will be a fall in 
pa , can only decrease Db and increase Da. But what will happen to 
Oa and Ob? It is impossible to say. Oa is equal to the product of Db 
multiplied by pb . Now, if one of these two factors, say pb, decreases 
or increases, the other factor, Db, must increase or decrease as a 
result. Likewise, Ob is equal to the product of Da multiplied by pa. 
Now, according as pa increases or decreases, Da must decrease or 
increase as a result. How consequently can we know if we are mov-
ing toward equilibrium?

Notes
i Being faithful to Walras’s textual terminology, neither here nor elsewhere 
do we write ‘quantity supplied’ and ‘quantity demanded’ unless he specif-
ically used that terminology. He used the Marshallian terminology occa-
sionally, but he had his own terminology, explaining in §§ 42 and 45 that 
he calls a quantity supplied, that is, a speciic amount at a speciic price, ‘an 
efective supply’, and a quantity demanded, that is, a speciic amount at a 
speciic price, ‘an efective demand’. In any event, it is clear from the con-
text when he meant speciic quantities as distinct from the entire supply or 
demand function.
ii he meaning of the word ‘Bourse’ in French is ‘a public market on which 
stocks, or bonds, or both; or commodities, or services, are traded’. Walras 
used the word ‘Bourse’ here in conjunction with the word ‘Paris’, thus refer-
ring to the institution with those two words as its name, a market on which 
stocks and bonds are traded. He also used the word, without explicitly 
using the word ‘Paris’ but in obvious reference to the Paris Bourse, when he 
dealt with French government bonds, and in that and in similar instances 
we have retained his word ‘Bourse’. Elsewhere he used the word ‘Bourse’, 
always capitalized as is the French custom, to refer to a securities exchange 
in any town, and in those instances we have translated ‘Bourse’ as ‘stock 
exchange’.
iii oats is ‘Avoine’ in French, and wheat is ‘Blé’.

LESSON 6

Curves of efective demand and  
efective supply

SUMMARy: – Fact of the decrease of efective demand caused by 
the increase of the price. Curves or equations of partial demand 
as a function of the price. Curves or equations of total demand. 
Demand curves are also supply curves. Hyperbolas of the exist-
ing quantity. Intermediate position of demand curves between the 
coordinate axes and the hyperbolas of the existing quantity.
Solution of the problem of the exchange of two commodities for 
each other. Geometric solution by inscription under the demand 
curves of rectangles with reciprocal bases and ordinates that are 
inversely equal to their surfaces. Algebraic solution. Combination 
of the two solutions by the construction of supply curves as a 
function of prices. Law of efective supply and demand, or of the 
determination of equilibrium prices.
49. Since we will assume that there is only an indirect or mediate 
relation between price and efective supply, and that the direct and 
immediate relation is between price and efective demand, it is the 
latter that we must study.
We consider, for this purpose, one of the holders of wheat. his 
individual has wheat, but he has no oats; he wants to retain a certain 
quantity of wheat for himself, and to give up a certain quantity of it 
in exchange for oats for his horses. As for the respective quantities 
that he will retain and give up, they depend on the price of oats 
and on the quantity of oats that he will demand having regard to 
its price. How does this happen? hat is what must be seen. Very 
well, at a price of zero (if he has to give zero hectoliters of wheat 
for one hectoliter of oats; in other words, if oats are free), our man 


Curves of efective demand and efective supply 53

will demand all the oats he wants; that is to say, enough for all the 
horses he owns and even for all those he could own on the assump-
tion that it costs nothing to feed horses. He will not have to give up 
any wheat at all in exchange. At the successive prices, 1/1000, 1/100, 
1/10, 1/5, 1/2,  (if 1/1000, 1/100, 1/10, 1/5, 1/2,  hectoliters of 
wheat have to be given up for one hectoliter of oats), he will progres-
sively reduce his demand. At the prices 1, 2, 5, 10,  (if 1, 2, 5, 10,   
hectoliters of wheat have to be given up to obtain one hectoliter of 
oats), he will reduce his demand even more. At the same time, the 
quantity of wheat that he ofers in exchange will always equal the 
quantity of oats he demands multiplied by the price of oats. Finally, 
at some more or less high price, for example, at a price of 100 (if 
100 hectoliters of wheat have to be given up for 1 hectoliter of oats), 
our man will not demand any oats at all, because, at that price, he 
will no longer be able or will not want to feed a single horse. It is 
clear, besides, that at that point, he will no longer ofer any wheat 
in exchange. It is therefore truly the case that, in that process, the 
efective demand for oats diminishes as the price increases: it begins 
at a certain quantity at a zero price, and ends up at a zero quan-
tity at a certain price. As for the corresponding efective supply of 
wheat, it starts at zero, increases, attains at least one maximum, then 
decreases and returns to zero.
50. All the holders of wheat, and not only all the holders of wheat on 
one side of the market, but all the holders of oats on the other side, 
have dispositions to trade that are not the same, but are analogous. 
And, in a general fashion, all holders of any commodity whatsoever 
who go to the market to exchange a certain quantity of that com-
modity for a certain quantity of whatever other commodity go there 
with certain virtual or efective dispositions to buy or sell that are sus-
ceptible of a rigorous determination.
A holder (1) of a quantity qb of commodity (B), as we hereby spe-
cify in passing from concrete examples to algebraic notation, comes 
to the market to exchange a quantity ob of (B), in return for a quantity 
da of (A) in conformity with the equation of exchange
dava = obvb ,


54 heory of exchange

and he leaves the market carrying away a quantity da of (A) and 
a quantity y q o q d v
b b b a v

a
b

= − = − of (B). In one way or another, 
between the quantities qb , v
v

a
b

 or pa , da, and y, there is always the 

relation
qb = y + da pa .
our man knows what amount qb is. He does not know, before 
arriving at the market, what v
v

a
b

 or pa will be; but he is certain that 
he will learn it as soon as he arrives, and that, this value of pa once 
being known, he must immediately decide upon a certain value of da,  
from which value, by virtue of the above equation, y will inally be 
determined.
If our man goes to the market in person, he can leave his dispo-
sitions to buy or sell for the time being in the virtual state and not 
efective; that is to say, he may not determine what his demand da will 
be until the price pa is known. hose dispositions nevertheless exist. 
But if he were prevented from going to the market himself, or if, for 
one reason or another, he had to have his trades made by a friend or 
give his orders to an agent, he would have to anticipate all the pos-
sible values of pa from zero to ininity and determine accordingly 
all the corresponding values of da, expressing them in one way or 
another. Now, all persons at all familiar with mathematics know that 
there are two ways of representing the expression mathematically.
51. Consider two coordinate axes, as drawn in Fig. 1 a horizontal 
price axis, op, and a vertical demand axis, od. on the price axis, 
beginning at the origin o, I mark of the lengths opa′ , opa′′, op′a′′ , 
 representing various possible prices of oats in terms of wheat, or 
of (A) in terms of (B). on the other axis, beginning at the same origin 
o, I mark of the length oad,1 representing the quantity of oats or (A) 
that our holder of wheat or (B) will demand at the price zero. on lines 


Curves of efective demand and efective supply 55

drawn through the points pa′, pa′′,  parallel to the vertical demand 
axis, I lay of the lengths pa′a1′, pa′′a1′′, , corresponding to the quan-
tities of oats or (A) that will be demanded at the prices pa′, pa′′,  
respectively. he length oap,1 represents the price at which our holder 
of wheat or (B) will not demand any oats or (A).
hat being done, the dispositions to trade of holder (1) of com-
modity (B) are expressed either geometrically by the curve ad,1ap,1 
drawn through the points ad,1, a1′,a1′′, , ap,1 , or algebraically by the 
equation da = fa,1(pa ) of this curve. he curve ad,1ap,1 and the equation 
da = fa,1(pa ) are empirical. In the same way, we would obtain the curves 
ad,2ap,2, ad,3ap,3,  or their equations da = fa,2 (pa ), da = fa,3 (pa ), 

 
(Fig. 2), expressing geometrically or algebraically the dispositions to 
trade of all the other holders of (B), individuals (2), (3), .

52. If we now add together all the partial curves ad,1ap,1, ad,2ap,2 , ad,3ap,3 , 
 by joining all the ordinates with the same abscissa, we obtain a 
total curve AdAp (Fig. 3), representing geometrically the dispositions 
to trade of all the holders of (B). If we then sum up all the partial 
equations, we obtain a total equation
Da = fa,1 (pa ) + fa,2 ( pa ) + fa,3 (pa ) + = Fa (pa )
expressing those dispositions algebraically. hat is the demand curve 
or the demand equation for (A) in exchange for (B) as a function 
of the price of (A) in terms of (B). Similarly, we could derive the 
demand curve or the demand equation of (B) in exchange for (A) as 
a function of the price of (B) in terms of (A).
Nothing indicates that the partial curves or partial equations, 
ad,1ap,1 or da = fa,1(pa ), and the other ones, are continuous; that is to 
say, that an ininitesimally small increase in pa produces an inini-
tesimally small decrease in da. on the contrary, these functions are 
oten discontinuous. In the case of oats, for example, it is certain 
that our irst holder of wheat will reduce his demand for wheat not 

Fig. 2


Curves of efective demand and efective supply 57

along with the rise of the price but in an intermittent way each time 
he decides to have one horse less in his stable. His partial demand 
curve will therefore, in reality, have the form of the stepped path 
passing through the point a (Fig. 4). he same will be true of all the 
others. And nevertheless the total demand curve AdAp (Fig. 3) can, 
by virtue of the so-called law of large numbers, be considered for all 
practical purposes as continuous. In fact, when a very small increase 
in price occurs, at least one of the holders of (B), out of the large 
number of them, reaches the point of being obliged to do without 
one horse, and there will also occur a very small diminution in the 
total demand.
53. In these conditions, the curve AdAp therefore gives the quantity 
of (A) efectively demanded as a function of the price of (A). For 
example, at the price pa,m, represented by the abscissa opa,m of the 
point Am, the efective demand is Da,m, represented by the ordinate

oDa,m of the same point Am. Moreover, when the efective demand 
for (A) in exchange for (B) is Da,m at the price pa,m, the efective supply 
of (B) in exchange for (A) is, in consequence, Ob,m = Da,m pa,m (§ 45), 
represented by the area of the rectangle oDa,mAmPa,m with a base 
of opa,m and a height oda,m . hus the curve Ad Ap shows both the 
demand for (A) and the supply of (B) as a function of the price of 
(A) in terms of (B). Similarly, the curve BdBp of Fig. 5 shows both the 
demand for (B) and the supply of (A) as a function of the price of (B) 
in terms of (A).
54. Let Qbi be the total quantity of (B) existing in the market in the 
hands of holders of (B), and let an equilateral hyperbola [with equa-
tion] xy = Qb, with the axes as asymptotes, be drawn through the point 
Qb. Let the line pa,m Am be extended until it meets the hyperbola at the 
point Qb, and let the line βQb be drawn parallel to the x axis, i.e.,  
the price axis. he surface Qb of the rectangle oβQbpa,m represents 
the total quantity of (B) brought to the market; Da,m multiplied by 


Curves of efective demand and efective supply 59

pa,m is the area of the rectangle oDa,mAmPa,m representing that part 
of the total quantity of (B) that is given up in exchange for (A) at the 
price pa,m; and, consequently, Y = Qb − Da,m pa,m, the area of the rect-
angle Da,mβQbAm, that is Qb − Da,m pa,m, represents the part that would 
be withheld from the market and kept by the holders at the price pa,m.  
Now, in any case, there will always be, between the quantities Qb, pa , 
Da and Y, the relation
Qb = Y + Da pa .
hus, [the hyperbola with equation] xy = Qb, or the curve passing 
through the point Qb, is the hyperbola of the existing quantity of (B), 
and AdAp is the curve that separates the part of (B) that is exchanged 
for (A) and the part that is withheld from sale depending on the 
prices of (A) in terms of (B). Naturally, the same general relation-
ship could be found between the curve BdBp and the hyperbola of the 
existing quantity of (A), the equation of which would be xy = Qa .

55. Demand curves are, therefore, enclosed in the quantity hyper-
bolas. It can also be said that generally those curves meet the coord-
inate axes and are not asymptotic to them.
hey generally intersect their demand axes. In fact, the quantity 
of any commodity demanded by an individual at a zero price is 
generally inite. If oats were free, some individuals would perhaps 
have dozens or hundreds of horses; but they would not have an 
ininite number of them and consequently would not demand an 
ininite quantity of oats. Now, the sum total of the demands at the 
price zero being the sum of inite quantities, it would itself be a 
inite quantity.
hey usually intersect the price axis. In fact, it can generally be 
assumed that there is a price high enough, though not ininite, at 
which any commodity is no longer demanded by anyone even in an 
ininitely small quantity. We cannot, however, make any absolute 
statement about this matter. It is perfectly possible for a case to occur 
in which commodity (B) is ofered at each possible price, either in 
the total amount existing or in part, and in which case the demand 
curve AdAp will coincide, totally or in part, with the hyperbola pass-
ing through Qb or with some other interior hyperbola. hat is why, 
so as not to prejudge anything, we will consider demand curves as 
being susceptible of taking all the positions between the coordinate 
axes and the hyperbolas of the existing quantity.
56. We now know completely the direct and immediate relationship 
that links the efective demand for a commodity to its price in terms 
of another commodity, or, at least, we know the nature of the rela-
tionship and we have conceived a mathematical expression for it.
hus, for the commodity (A), this relationship can be expressed 
geometrically by the curve AdAp, or algebraically by the equation 
(§ 52) of that curve
Da = Fa (pa ).
For the commodity (B), it can be expressed geometrically by the 
curve BdBp, or algebraically by the equation of that curve
Db = Fb ( pb ).


Curves of efective demand and efective supply 61

Moreover, we also know the nature of the indirect and mediate 
relationship that exists between the efective supply of one commod-
ity ofered in exchange for another and the price of the other com-
modity in terms of the irst, and we have conceived a mathematical 
expression for this relationship.
For the commodity (A), the relationship in question would be 
expressed geometrically by a series of rectangles inscribed within the 
curve BdBp, or algebraically by the equation (§ 53)
Oa = Db pb = Fb (pb )pb .
For the commodity (B), the relationship would be expressed geo-
metrically by a series of rectangles inscribed within the curve AdAp, 
or algebraically by the equation
Ob = Da pa = Fa ( pa ) pa .
Nothing is easier than to deduce from the latter expressions those 
of the relationship that links the efective supply of each commodity 
to its price in terms of the other commodity. It is only necessary to 
replace, in the last two equations, the price pb by 1

pa and the price pa 

by 1

pb in virtue of the relationship pa pb = 1. It then results that
O
a = Fb pa pa Ob = Fa pb pb

With all these elements, we are in a position to solve mathemat-
ically the general problem of the exchange of two commodities for 
each other, which consists, being given two commodities, (A) and (B), 
and the demand curve of each in terms of the other, or the equations of 
these curves, in determining their respective equilibrium prices.
57. Geometrically, the problem consists in inscribing within the 
two curves AdAp and BdBp [of Fig. 6] two rectangles with reciprocal 
bases, oDa Apa and oDbBpb respectively, such that their heights are 


62 heory of exchange

so related that the height of the irst, oDa , is equal to the area of the 
second, oDb × opb , and that, conversely, the height of the second, 
oDb , is equal to the area of the irst, oDa × opa . he bases of these 
two rectangles, opa and opb , represent equilibrium prices, since, at 
these respective prices, the demand for (A), represented by the height 
oDa , equals the supply of (A) represented by the area oDb × opb , 
and the demand for (B), represented by the height oDb , equals the 
supply of (B), represented by the area oDa × opa (§ 47).
he expression of which I made use: the height of either rectangle is 
equal to the area of the other, is not homogeneous.ii But homogeneity 
in these circumstances is not necessary for the reason that the con-
dition that the bases be reciprocals of each other implies the deter-
mination of the common unit oI that was used in the construction 
of both curves. It could also be said, if even more clarity is desired, 
that the height of each rectangle should contain the unit of length 
as many times as the other rectangle contains the unit of area; or,

putting it yet another way, that the area of each rectangle should be 
equal to the area of a rectangle constructed with the same height 
as the other rectangle and a base of one unit. It follows, moreover, 
under the given conditions of the problem, that the bases of the two 
rectangles are inversely equal to the ratio of the heights and directly 
equal to the ratio of the areas.
58. Algebraically, the problem consists in inding the two roots pa 
and pb , of the two equations
Fa (pa ) = Fb (pb ) pb , pa pb = 1;
or the two roots, pa and pb , of the two equations
Fb (pb )pa = Fb (pb ), pa pb = 1;

these will be the curves KLM and NPQ (Fig. 7), the intersection of 
which with the irst pair, at the points A and B, will furnish precisely 
the rectangles that were mentioned above.
It is easy to take cognizance of the meaning of the curves KLM and 
NPQ that are drawn as dotted curves in the igure, and of the manner 
of their construction.
he irst, KLM, is a supply curve of (A), no longer identiied by 
means of the demand curve of (B), which gave the supply of (A) as a 
function of pb as the areas of inscribed rectangles constructed on the 
coordinate axes, but distinct from it and giving that same supply of 
(A) by the length of the ordinates as a function of pa .
he curve starts from an ordinate of zero at an ininitely high price 
of (A) in terms of (B), corresponding to an ininitesimally small price 
of (B) in terms of (A); that is to say, KLM is asymptotic to the price 
axis. he curve rises as it approaches the origin, with each fall in the 
price of (A) in terms of (B) corresponding to a rise in the price of (B) 
in terms of (A). It reaches its maximum at the point L, the abscissa of 
which represents a price of (A) in terms of (B), the inverse of pb,m ,

the price of (B) in terms of (A), measured by the abscissa opb,m of 
the point Bm , at which the rectangle inscribed within BdBp is a max-
imum. hen the curve falls as it approaches the origin until its ordin-
ate becomes zero again at a price of (A) in terms of (B) represented 
by the length oK, the inverse of the price of (B) in terms of (A) meas-
ured by the abscissa oBp of the point Bp where the curve BdBp meets 
the price axis.
Similarly, the second curve, NPQ, is the supply curve of (B), no 
longer derived from the demand curve of (A), which gave the supply 
of (B) as a function of pa as the areas of inscribed rectangles con-
structed on the coordinate axes, but distinct from it and giving the 
supply of (B) by the lengths of the ordinates as a function of pb .
hat curve, NPQ, starts from an ordinate of zero at an ininitely 
high price of (B) in terms of (A), corresponding to an ininitesimally 
small price of (A) in terms of (B); that is to say, it is asymptotic to the 
price axis. It rises as it moves toward the origin, with each fall in the 
price of (B) in terms of (A) corresponding to a rise in the price of 
(A) in terms of (B). It reaches a maximum at the point P, the abscissa 
of which represents a price of (B) in terms of (A), the inverse of the 
price pb,m of (A) in terms of (B), measured by the abscissa opa,m of 
the point Am at which the rectangle inscribed within AdAp is a max-
imum. hen the curve falls as it approaches the origin until it returns 
to zero at a price of (B) in terms of (A), represented by the length 
oN, this price being the reciprocal of the price of (A) in terms of 
(B) measured by the abscissa oAp of the point Ap at which the curve 
AdAp meets the price axis.
It goes without saying that the shapes of the curves KLM and NPQ 
are essentially related to the shapes of BdBp and AdAp respectively. If 
the latter curves were assumed to be diferent, the former would also 
be entirely diferent. At all events, under the given conditions that we 
have assumed, the curve BdBp, while falling from let to right, ater 
having passed the maximum point Bm, meets the dotted curve NPQ 
at the point at which that curve rises from zero to its maximum P; 
and, consequently, the curve AdAp while also falling, before passing 
through the maximum point Am, meets the dotted curve KLM at the 
point at which it falls from its maximum L to zero.iii

60. Now, ater all that has been noted, it is evident that if the two 
curves AdAp and KLM intersect at the point A, on the right or on 
the let of this point, alternatively, the curve AdAP lies below or above 
the curve KLM; and that, similarly, if the two curves BdBp and NPQ 
intersect at the point B, to the right or to the let of this point, alterna-
tively, the curve BdBp is above or below the curve NPQ.
hus, since the prices pa = 1

µ and pb = µ are, by hypothesis, 
those at which Da = Oa and Db = Ob, it follows that at all prices of 
(A) in terms of (B) higher than pa , corresponding to prices of (B) 
in terms of (A) lower than pb , we will have at the same time Oa > Da 
and Db > Ob . And, conversely, at all prices of (A) in terms of (B) lower 
than pa , corresponding to prices of (B) in terms of (A) higher than 
pb , we will have at the same time Da > Oa and Ob > Db . In the irst 
case, the equilibrium price could only be reached by an increase in 
pb , which would be a decrease in pa . In the second case, equilibrium 
price could only be reached by an increase in pa , which would be a 
decrease in pb .
his leads us to formulate in the following terms the law of efective 
supply and efective demand, or the law of the determination of equilib-
rium prices in the case of the exchange of two commodities for each 
other: - Given two commodities, for the market to be in equilibrium 
with respect to those commodities, or for the price of either commodity 
to be stationary in terms of the other, it is necessary and suicient that 
the efective demand for each of these two commodities be equal to its 
efective supply. When this equality does not obtain, it is necessary, in 
order to arrive at the equilibrium price, for there to be a rise in the price 
of the commodity for which the efective demand is greater than the 
efective supply, and a fall in the price of the one for which the efective 
supply is greater than the efective demand.
hat is the law that we might have been tempted to formulate 
immediately ater our study of the Bourse (§ 42); but a rigorous dem-
onstration was necessary (§ 48).
61. It is clearly seen now what the mechanism of competition in 
the market is: it is the practical solution, reached through raising 
and lowering of prices, of the problem of exchange for which we 
have furnished the theoretical and mathematical solution. It must 


Curves of efective demand and efective supply 67

furthermore be understood that we have no intention of substitut-
ing one solution for the other. he practical solution has a rapidity 
and reliability that leaves nothing to be desired. It can be seen, on big 
markets that function even without agents or criers, that the current 
equilibrium price is determined in a few minutes, and considerable 
quantities of merchandise are exchanged at that price in half or three 
quarters of an hour. By contrast, the theoretical solution would be, in 
almost all cases, completely impractical.iv It follows that to speak to us 
about the diiculty of establishing the empirical curves of exchange 
or their equations would be to make a very strange objection. he 
advantage there may be, in certain cases, of constructing, totally or 
partially, the demand curve or the supply curve of a given commod-
ity, and the possibility or impossibility of doing so, is a question that 
we defer entirely. For the moment, we are studying the problem of 
exchange in general, and the pure and simple concept of curves of 
exchange is suicient and at the same time indispensable.

iv Walras here is indicating that in the theoretical model on a market day, all 
of the exchanges on a given day take place at the price at which supply and 
demand are equal. In real competitive markets, however, he indicates that 
there are exchanges at disequilibrium prices as the market moves toward 
equilibrium; but, he goes on to explain, a price is quickly found at which 
supply and demand are equal, and, although all trade does not occur at that 
price, ‘considerable quantities’ are exchanged at it. Moreover, the trading at 
the price that equates current demand and supply goes on for a relatively 
long period of real time.

LESSON 7

Discussion of the solution of the problem of 
exchange of two commodities for each other

SUMMARy: – Discussion restricted to the case of supply curves 
that are continuous and have a single maximum. he supply curves 
do not intersect the demand curves; no equilibrium price. he 
supply curves intersect the demand curves in three points; three 
equilibrium prices. Two stable equilibrium prices; one unstable 
equilibrium price. one of the two demand curves coincides with 
the hyperbola of the existing quantity. Both of them coincide.
62. To summarize: given two commodities (A) and (B) for which the 
relationships between the efective demand and the price are estab-
lished by the equations
Da = Fa (pa ), Db = Fb ( pb ),
the equilibrium price is given by the equation
Dava = Dbvb ;
that is to say, replacing D a and D b with their values, by the equation
Fa ( pa )va = Fb (pb )vb ,
which can be written in the form

a ( a ) = b pa pa

according to whether we wish to solve for pa or pb. he irst of these 
two forms states that Da = Oa ; the second states that Ob = Db .
We have solved the equation in its two forms (§ 59) by the inter-
section of the curves

but this solution requires further discussion.
63. We will not discuss it for all possible cases, which would be much 
too lengthy and, moreover, premature, but only for the fairly simple 
general case portrayed in our igure [Fig. 7 of the preceding chapter]. 
In this igure, we assumed that the curves AdAp and BdBp are con-
tinuous, and have only one maximum for the rectangles with coordi-
nates (pa , Da ) and (pb , Db ), between [respectively] the point at which 
Da = oAd and pa = 0, and the point at which pa = oAp and Da = 0, 
and between the point at which Db = oBd and pb = 0, and the point at 
which pb = oBp and Db = 0. We need, furthermore, consider only that 
portion of each of these curves that falls within the irst quadrant, 
and, regarding that portion, the part that lies between the points Ad 
and Ap, and between the points Bd and Bp. his very evidently follows 
from the very nature of the fact of exchange. Given that hypothesis, 
KLM and NPQ are continuous curves, and have only one maximum 


70 heory of exchange

of the ordinates. Now, even in this case, thus deined and limited, 
there is material for an interesting discussion.
64. We have been reasoning as if AdAp and KLM, on the one hand, 
and as if BdBp and NPQ, on the other, intersect respectively at only 
one point A and only one point B. But irst of all, we must note that 
these curves may have no point of intersection at all. If, for example, 
BdBp ended up on the price axis at a point that lies to the let of the 
point N, it would not intersect the curve NPQ. In that case, further-
more, the curve KLM would itself leave the price axis at a point situ-
ated beyond the point Ap and it would not be intersected by the curve 
AdAp. here would be no solution.
here is nothing surprising about this eventuality. It corresponds 
to the case in which no holder of (B) is willing to give oAp of (B) for 
1 of (A), that is, 1 of (B) for 1
oAp

 [= oN] of (A), while, on the other 
hand, no holder of (A) is willing to give 1

oAp of (A) for 1 of (B), that 
is, 1 of (A) for oAp of (B). It is obvious that, in this case, the ofers 
to buy and sell would not result in any transactions on the market. If 
there were a price of (A) in terms of (B) less than oAp correspond-
ing to some price of (B) in terms of (A) greater than 1
oAp

, there 
would be plenty of demanders of (A) ofering (B) in exchange, but 

 

there would be no demanders of (B) in exchange for (A). And, if 
there were a price of (B) in terms of (A) below 1
oAp

, corresponding 
to some price of (A) in terms of (B) higher than Ap, there would be 
plenty of demanders of (B) who are suppliers of (A), but there would 
be no demanders of (A) who are suppliers of (B).
65. Now, ater the case in which the curves of demand and the curves 
of supply have only one point of intersection, and the case in which 
they have no point of intersection, a careful examination of the form 


he exchange of two commodities for each other 71

of the curves reveals the case in which there would be several points 
of intersection. If, for example [Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b], the two com-
modities (A) and (B) were such that, the demand for (A) in terms of 
(B) continuing to be represented by the curve AdAp, the demand for 
(B) in terms of (A) was represented by the curve B′dB′p, that curve 
B′dB′p would be intersected by the curve NPQ at the three points 
B, B′, and B″. In this case, the supply curve of (A) for (B), KLM, 
would be replaced by the curve K′L′M′, which would itself intersect 
the curve AdAp at the three points A, A′, and A″, the point A corre-
sponding to the point B, the point A′ to the point B′, and the point 
A″ to the point B″. here would thus be three diferent solutions to 
the problem of exchange of two commodities (A) and (B) for each 
other since there would be three systems each with two rectangles 

Fig. 8a


72 heory of exchange

with reciprocal bases, inscribed within the curves AdAp and B′d B′p, 
and each having heights that would be inversely equal to their areas. 
But do these three solutions have the same importance?
66. Among the three systems, if we irst examine those that relate to 
the points A′ and B′ and A″ and B″, we ind ourselves in conditions 
identical to those of the system relative to the points A and B in the 
case of a unique solution (§ 60). To the right or to the let of the point 
A′, where the two curves AdAp and K′L′M′ intersect, the curve AdAp 
is below or above the curve K′L′M′; and similarly, to the right or to 
the let of the point B′, where the two curves Bd′ B′p and NPQ inter-
sect, the curve Bd′ B′p is below or above the curve NPQ. To the right or

to the let of the point A″, the curve AdAp is below or above the curve 
K′L′M′; and, similarly again, to the right or to the let of the point B″, 
the curve Bd′ B′p is below or above the curve NPQ.
In the two cases, beyond the point of equilibrium, the supply of the 
commodity in question is greater than the demand for it, which must 
result in a fall in price, that is, in a return to the point of equilibrium. 
In the two cases, to the let of the point of equilibrium, the demand 
for the commodity in question is greater than the supply, which must 
result in a rise in price, that is, in a movement towards the point of 
equilibrium. We can therefore exactly compare that equilibrium to 
that of a suspended body whose center of gravity lies directly on a 
vertical line beneath the point of suspension, so that the center of 
gravity, if displaced from its vertical position, would automatically 
return to its original position simply by the force of gravity. hat is a 
stable equilibrium.
67. he same does not hold regarding the points A and B of Fig. 8a 
and 8b. he curve AdAp lies above the curve K′L′M′ to the right, and 
below the curve K′L′M′ to the let of the point A. Likewise, the curve 
B′d B′p lies above the curve NPQ to the right, and below the curve 
NPQ to the let of the point B. Hence, in this case, to the right of the 
point of equilibrium, the demand for the commodity is greater than its 
supply, which must lead to a rise in the price, that is, to a movement 
away from the point of equilibrium. And, in this case, to the let of 
the point of equilibrium, the supply of the commodity is greater than 
the demand for it, which must lead to a fall in the price, that is, to 
a movement again away from the point of equilibrium. his equi-
librium is therefore exactly comparable to that of a body that has a 
point of suspension lying on a vertical line directly beneath the cen-
ter of gravity, so that if this center of gravity leaves the vertical line, 
the body moves further and further away, not restoring its position, 
and solely through the force of gravity it places itself below the point 
of suspension. hat sort of equilibrium is unstable.
68. In reality, only the systems A′, B′ and A″, B″ give solutions to the 
problem, and the system A, B marks only the point of separation and 
the limit of the ield respectively of each of the two solutions. To the 


74 heory of exchange
right of pb = µ, the price of (B) in terms of (A) tends to move toward 
the equilibrium price pb′′ which is the abscissa of the point B′; to the 
let of pb , it tends toward the price pb′, which is the abscissa of the 
point B′. Correlatively, to the let of pa = 1
µ

, the price of (A) in terms 
of (B) tends toward the equilibrium price pa′′, which is the abscissa 
of the point A″; while to the right of pa it tends toward the price pa′, 
which is the abscissa of the point A′.
his eventuality corresponds, as is easily seen, to the case in 
which it happens, because of the nature of the two commodities, 
that a relatively large quantity of (A), which is demanded at a rela-
tively low price of (A) in terms of (B), can have the same value 
as a relatively small quantity of (B) demanded at a relatively high 
price of (B) in terms of (A), and at the same time that a relatively 
small quantity of (A), which is demanded at a relatively high price 
of (A) in terms of (B), can have the same value as a relatively large 
quantity of (B) demanded at a relatively low price of (B) in terms 
of (A). hen, according to whether the pricing starts at a low price 
of (A) in terms of (B) corresponding to a high price of (B) in terms 
of (A), or at a low price of (B) in terms of (A) corresponding to a 
high price of (A) in terms of (B), it will eventuate in the irst or the 
second of the two equilibria. We are forced to recognize that even-
tuality as being theoretically possible for two commodities that are 
exchanged for each other; we will see later if it is still possible for 
several commodities that are exchanged for one another with the 
intervention of money.
69. hus far we have assumed, in all our discussion, that the demand 
curves AdAp, BdBp, and B′dB′p intersect both the coordinate axes. 
Without departing from the given conditions of our general hypoth-
esis, it is appropriate to examine the extreme case in which the 
demand curves, by coinciding with the hyperbola of the existing 
quantity, would be asymptotic to these axes.
For example, if AdAp coincided with the hyperbola Da pa = Qb , all 
of the commodity (B) being ofered at each price, the equation

would become

which represents the intersection at πa of the curve passing through 
the point Qb and the curve KLM (Fig. 9). I am abstracting from the 
solution given by the equation 1

would then become
Qb = Fb (pb ),
which represents the intersection at πb of the curve BdBp and a straight 
line N′P′Q′ lying parallel to the price axis at a distance oN′ = Qb.
70. Finally, if all of both commodities were ofered at each possible 
price, we would have at the same time

hus, in this last case, the two commodities would be exchanged 
for each other purely and simply in the inverse ratio of the existing 
quantities; that is to say, the exchange would take place according to 
the equation
Qava = Qbvb .
And, moreover, as is very easily seen, that equality of the exist-
ing quantities and the quantities exchanged would then represent 
the equality of the efective supply and the demand for both the 
commodities.

LESSON 8

Utility or want curves. he theorem of 
maximum satisfaction

SUMMARy: – Circumstance that determines the intercept on 
the quantity axis of the partial demand curves: extensive utility. 
Circumstance that determines their slope and intercept on 
the price axis: intensive utility. Inluence of the quantity pos-
sessed. Hypothesis of a unit of measurement of utility or want. 
Construction of the curves of utility or want. hey are curves of 
efective utility and of rareté as functions of the quantity possessed.
Exchange takes place in order to maximize satisfaction of wants. 
he exchange of a quantity ob of (B) for a quantity da of (A), ater 
which the ratio of the rareté of (A) to the rareté of (B) is equal to 
the price pa , is advantageous. his exchange is more advantageous 
than any other exchange of two quantities smaller or greater than 
ob and da. Hence, maximum satisfaction of wants occurs when the 
ratio of the raretés is equal to the price. Equation of the demand 
curve deduced from the condition of maximum satisfaction. he 
case of discontinuous want curves.
71. our study of the nature of the fact of exchange up to this point 
makes possible the study of the cause of the fact of value in exchange. 
If it is true that prices or ratios of values result mathematically from 
demand curves, then to know the causes and primary conditions of 
the determination and variation of prices, it is necessary to study the 
causes and primary conditions of the establishment and variation of 
demand curves.
Let us, therefore, return to the partial demand curves,i and take, 
for example, the curve ad,1ap,1 (Fig. 10) or its equation da = fa,1(pa ) 


78 heory of exchange

(§ 51), expressing respectively geometrically or algebraically the dis-
positions of holder (1) of (B) to buy (A); and let us irst consider the 
circumstance that determines the position of the point ad,1 where 
the curve leaves the demand axis. he length oad,1 represents the 
quantity of (A) efectively demanded by that individual at a zero 
price; that is to say, it represents the quantity he would consume if 
the commodity were free. Now, upon what does this quantity gener-
ally depend? on the utility of the commodity, or at least on a certain 
kind of utility of the commodity that we will call extensive utility 
because this type of wealth satisies wants that are more or less exten-
sive or numerous, because more or fewer men experience them, or 
because those who experience them do so in a greater or lesser pro-
portion, because, in a word, abstracting from any sacriice that has 
to be made to obtain them, the commodity would be consumed in a 
greater or lesser quantity. his irst circumstance is simple or abso-
lute in the respect that the extensive utility of (A) inluences only the 
demand curves of (A) and not the demand curves of (B), and, simi-
larly, the extensive utility of (B) inluences only the demand curves 
of (B) and not the demand curves of (A). Furthermore, extensive 
utility is a mathematical fact in that the quantity demanded at a zero 
price is a measurable quantity.

Utility or want curves 79

72. But extensive utility is not the whole of utility; it is only one of its 
constituent elements. here is another which reveals itself if we turn 
our attention to the circumstance that determines the slope of the 
curve ad,1ap,1, and consequently the position of the point ap,1 where 
the curve ends up on the price axis. he slope of the curve is nothing 
other than the ratio of two quantities: the increase in price and the 
decrease in demand caused by that increase. Now, upon what does 
this ratio generally depend? It is again the utility of the commodity, 
but another sort of utility that we will call intensive utility because this 
type of wealth satisies wants that are more or less intense or urgent, 
either because the wants exist, despite their dearness, in a more or 
less great number of men, or because they exist more or less in those 
who experience them, because, in a word, the greatness of the sacri-
ice that has to be made to obtain them has a greater or lesser inlu-
ence upon the quantity of the commodity consumed. Unlike the irst 
attribute of utility, this second circumstance is complex or relative in 
the respect that the slopes of the demand curves for (A) depend not 
only on the intensive utility of (A) but also on the intensive utility of 
(B), just as the slopes of the demand curves for (B) depend not only 
on the intensive utility of (B) but also on the intensive utility of (A). 
hus the slope of the demand curves deined as the limit of the ratio 
of a decrease of demand to the increase of the price, which would be a 
mathematical circumstance very easy to determine, presents us with 
a more or less complex relationship between the intensive utility of 
the two commodities.

73. here is, moreover, another circumstance that also inluences the 
slope of the curve ad,1ap,1 of the demand for (A): that is the quantity 
qb of commodity (B) being in the possession of individual (1), who 
is a holder of this commodity. Generally, the partial demand curves 
are below the partial quantity hyperbolas, just like the curves of total 
demand are below the hyperbolas of total quantities. If, therefore, 
the partial quantity hyperbola changes while moving toward or away 
from the origin of the coordinate axes, the partial demand curve will 
vary in the same way, just as it would also do as a result of a variation 


80 heory of exchange

of the intensive utilities. In both cases, the igure depicts this neces-
sary behavior faithfully.
74. his analysis is incomplete; and it seems impossible, at irst glance, 
to pursue it further, because of the fact that absolute intensive utility 
eludes us because it has no direct or measurable relationship to space 
or time, unlike extensive utility and the quantity of a commodity pos-
sessed. So be it! his diiculty is not insurmountable. Let us assume 
that the relationship exists, and we will be able to give an exact and 
mathematical account of the respective inluences on prices of exten-
sive utility, intensive utility, and the quantity possessed.
I therefore assume that there is a standard of measurement of 
wants or intensive utility, common not only to similar units of the 
same kind of wealth but also to diferent units of various kinds of 
wealth. Accordingly, let there be [Fig. 11] two coordinate axes, one 
vertical, oq, and the other horizontal, or. on the former, oq, starting

Utility or want curves 81
at the point o, I mark of the successive lengths, oq′,q′q′′, q′′q′′′, , 
which represent the units of (B) that holder (1) would successively 
consume if he had those units at his disposition. But all these succes-
sive units have, for holder (1), an intensive utility that is decreasing 
ater the irst unit, namely the one that satisies the most urgent want, 
until the least urgent want is satisied, ater which satiation is reached; 
and the question arises of how to state this decrease mathematically. 
If commodity (B) is naturally consumed in whole units, like pieces of 
furniture or articles of clothing, I mark of on the horizontal axis or, 
and, on lines drawn parallel to this axis through the points q′, q″, , 
the lengths oβr,1, q′r′′, q″r′′′, , which represent respectively the 
intensive utilities of each of the successive units consumed. I form the 
rectangles oq′R′βr,1, q′q″R″r″, q″q″′R″′r″′, , and obtain the curve 
βr,1 R′r″R″r″′R″′. his curve is discontinuous. If, on the other hand, 
commodity (B) could be consumed in ininitely small amounts, like 
food, the intensive utility would diminish not only from one unit 
to the next but also from the irst to the last fraction of each unit, 
and the discontinuous curve βr,1 R′r″R″r″′R″′ would change into 
the continuous curve βr,1 r″r″′  βq,1.ii Similarly, I could obtain the 
curve αr,1αq,1 for the commodity (A). In the case of continuity, as 
in the case of discontinuity, I assume that the intensive utilities are 
decreasing from the intensity of the utility of the irst unit or fraction 
of a unit consumed down to the intensity of the utility of the last unit 
or fraction of a unit consumed.
he lengths oβq,1 and oαq,1 (Fig. 12) represent the extensive util-
ities that the commodities (B) and (A) yield for holder (1), or the 
extent of the wants that holder (1) has for the commodities (B) and 
(A). he areas oβq,1βr,1 and oαq,1αr,1 represent the virtual utilities of 
the commodities (B) and (A) for the same holder, or the sum of the 
wants that the holder has, in extension and in intensity, for the same 
commodities. he curves αr,1αq,1 and βr,1βq,1 are therefore holder (1)’s 
utility curves or want curves for the commodities (A) and (B). But

75. In calling the sum total of wants satisied, extensively and inten-
sively, by a quantity consumed of a commodity its efective utility, the 
curve βr,1βq,1 would be the curve of efective utility as a function of 
the quantity of (B) consumed by our individual. hus (Fig. 12), for 
a quantity qb of (B) consumed represented by the length oqb , the 
efective utility would be represented by the area oqbρβr,1. And, in 
calling the intensity of the last want satisied by any given quantity 
consumed of a commodity its rareté, the curve βr,1βq,1 would be the 
rareté curve for the same individual as a function of the quantity 
consumed of (B). hus, if he consumes a quantity qb of (B), repre-
sented by the length oqb , the rareté would be ρb, represented by the 
length qbρ = oρb . he curve αr,1αq,1 would be, similarly, the curve 
of efective utility and of rareté, as a function of the quantity of (A) 
consumed. hat is why I can also call the two axes of coordinates the 
rareté axis and the quantity axis. It must be stated, I repeat, that rareté 
increases as the quantity possessed decreases, and reciprocally.
Analytically, the raretés being given as functions of the quan-
tities consumed by the equations r = ϕa,1 (q) and r = ϕb,1 (q), then the

All that being speciied, the extensive and intensive utility of com-
modity (A) for holder (1) of (B) being represented geometrically by 
the continuous curve αr,1αq,1, and algebraically by the equation of this 
curve r = ϕa,1 (q); the extensive and intensive utility of commodity 
(B) for this same holder being represented geometrically by the con-
tinuous curve βr,1βq,1 and algebraically by the equation of this curve, 
r = ϕb,1 (q); moreover, the quantity qb , represented by the length oqb, 
being the initial quantity of (B) that holder (1) possesses, let us 
see if we can specify what his demand for (A) will be at any given  
price.
76. Because of the way in which our want curves are established and 
the characteristics we have recognized that they have in construct-
ing them, it follows that if holder (1) reserved all of his qb units of 
(B) for his own consumption, he would satisfy a sum total of wants

represented by the area oqbρβr,1. his is not, however, what that indi-
vidual will generally do, because, generally, he will be able to satisfy a 
larger sum total of wants by consuming only part of his commodity 
and by exchanging the surplus for a certain quantity of (A) at the 
current price. If, for example [Fig. 13], at a price pa of (A) in terms of 
(B) he keeps only y units of (B) represented by oy, and exchanges the 
surplus ob = qb − y, represented by yqb for da units of (A), represented 
by oda , he will be able to satisfy a sum total of wants represented by 
the two areas, oyββr,1 and odaααr,1, a sum that could be greater than 
the previous one. Assuming that he undertakes the exchange in such 
a way as to satisfy the greatest possible sum total of wants, it is certain 
that, pa being given, da is determined by the condition that the sum 
of the two areas oyββr,1 and odaααr,1 is a maximum. What is that 
condition? I say that it is that the ratio of the intensities ra,1 and rb,1 
of the last wants satisied by the quantities da and y, or of the raretés 
ater the exchange, is equal to the price pa .
77. We assume that this condition is fulilled; then we have the two 
equations
ob = qb − y = da pa ,
ra,1 = parb,1.
Eliminating pa , we obtain
dara,1 = obrb,1,
or, replacing da, ob, ra,1 and rb,1 by the lengths by which they are repre-
sented in Fig. 13, namely oda , qb y , daα and yβ, we obtain
oda × daα = qb y × yβ.
hus the areas of the two rectangles odaαra,1 and yqbBβ are equal.iii 
But, by virtue of the nature of the curves αr,1αq,1 and βr,1βq,1 we have, 
on the one hand


Utility or want curves 85
area odaααr,1 > oda × daα
and on the other hand,
qb y × yβ > area yqbρβ.
herefore, we have
area odaααr,1 > area yqbρβ.
hus the exchange of a quantity ob of (B) for a quantity da of (A) 
is advantageous for our holder of (B), because the area of the satis-
faction he acquires thereby is greater than the area of satisfaction 
he relinquishes. his, however, is not suicient, and it must now be 
shown that that exchange is more advantageous for our holder than 
any other exchange of a quantity of (B) smaller or greater than ob in 
return for a quantity of (A) smaller or greater than da .
78. To do this, let us represent the entire exchange that has been made 
of ob of (B) for da of (A) as being composed of s successive equal par-
tial exchanges. In selling successively s times o
s

b of (B), and buying 

successively s times d

s

a of (A), in accordance with the equation of 

exchange
o
s

d

s p

b a

= a ,
our individual has decreased the rareté of (A) and increased the rareté 
of (B). It is in this way that the ratio of these raretés, which started 
out by being higher than the price pa , becomes equal to this price. 
Now, I say, irst, that under these conditions all the partial exchanges 
have been advantageous, although less and less advantageous from 
the irst to the sth.
Indeed, let oda′ and qb y′ be two lengths measured along oda and 
qby respectively, the irst above the point o, the other below the point 


86 heory of exchange
qb, the former representing the quantity d

s

a of (A), the latter repre-

senting the quantity o

s

b of (B), these being the quantities exchanged 
in the irst partial exchange. his irst exchange having been made, 
the ratio of the decreased raretés is still, by hypothesis, greater than 
the price, and we have, calling these raretés ra and rb ,
ra > parb ,
which gives, by virtue of the preceding equation,
d
s r

o

s r

a

that is, in replacing d

o

s

b , r r

a , and b by the lengths od′a, qb y′, da′α′, 
and y′β′ , which represent them geometrically,
oda′ × da′α′ > qb y′ × y′β′.
But, by virtue of the want curves we have, on the one hand,
area oda′α′αr,1 > oda′ × da′α′,
and on the other hand,
qb y′ × y′β′ > area y′qbρβ′.
We therefore have a fortiori
area oda′α′αr,1 > y′qbρβ′.


Utility or want curves 87
herefore, the irst exchange of o
s

b of (B) for 

d

s

a of (A) has been

 

advantageous. It can be shown similarly that the following s – 2 
exchanges, successively efectuated, have been advantageous, because 
the ratio of the raretés ater each exchange, though diminishing, was 
still, by hypothesis, greater than the price. It is, for example, evident 
that the advantage diminishes with the related diminution of the 
ratios of the raretés.
Now let the length dad′a′ be drawn directly below the point da and 
the length yy′′ be drawn directly above the point y. hese represent 
the same quantities exchanged in the last partial exchange, d
s

a of (A) 

and o

s

b of (B). his last exchange having been made, the ratio of the 
smaller raretés is, by hypothesis, equal to the price, and we have
ra,1 = parb,1,
which, by virtue of the equation of exchange, gives

that is to say, replacing d

s

b , ra,1,andrb,1 by the lengths dada′′, yy″, 
daα, and yβ that represent them, we obtain
dada′′× daα = yy′′ × yβ.
But, by virtue of the nature of the want curves, we have, on the one 
hand,
area da′′daαα″ > dada′′× daα
and on the other hand,


88 heory of exchange

yy″ × yβ > area yy″β″β.
We therefore have
area da′′daαα″ > area yy″β″β.
hus, the last exchange of o
s

b of (B) for 

d

s

a of (A) has still been 
advantageous. Since, moreover, we can assume s to be as large as we 
wish, it is therefore certain that all of the partial exchanges, without 
exception, including the last one however small it may be, have been 
advantageous, although less and less advantageous from the irst to 
the sth exchange. Consequently, holder (1) of (B) should not supply a 
quantity of (B) less than ob nor demand a quantity of (A) less than da .
79. We could demonstrate in the same way that there would not be 
supplied a quantity of (B) greater than ob or demanded a quantity of 
(A) greater than da , because all the partial exchanges without excep-
tion, including the irst, however small it may be, that would be made 
in excess of that limit would be disadvantageous, and increasingly 
disadvantageous. But this demonstration logically takes its place 
within the one we have just made. In fact, in continuing to diminish 
the rareté of (A) and to increase the rareté of (B) by the exchange of 
any quantity of (B) for a quantity of (A) of equal value, ater the limit 
constituted by the equality of the ratio of the raretés with the price pa 
has been reached, we arrive at the inequality
ra < parb ,
which can be put into the form
rb > pbra .
Now, in virtue of the demonstration that has been presented, it is cer-
tain that, in these conditions, maximum satisfaction would be more 
closely approached by exchanging additional quantities of (A) for 
additional quantities of (B), until the limit


Utility or want curves 89

rb,1 = pbra,1
has been attained; that is,
ra,1 = parb,1.

80. ob of (B) and da of (A), neither more nor less, will be the quantities 
of (B) and of (A) respectively that will be supplied and demanded by 
holder (1) at the price pa of (A) in terms of (B), if these quantities are 
the ones for which the relation ra,1 = parb,1 holds good.
In general: Given two commodities in a market, the maximum sat-
isfaction of wants, or maximum efective utility, is achieved, for each 
holder, when the ratio of the intensities of the last wants satisied, or the 
ratio of their raretés, is equal to the price. Until this equality has been 
reached, it is advantageous for the exchanger to sell the commodity the 
rareté of which is smaller than its price multiplied by the rareté of the 
other commodity, and to buy the other commodity the rareté of which 
is greater than its price multiplied by the rareté of the irst.
It can therefore be advantageous for the exchanger to ofer all of 
one of the two commodities that he holds and not to demand any of 
the other. We will return to this matter presently.
81. If, in the equation
ra,1 = parb,1,
we replace ra,1 andrb,1 by their values, then we get
ϕa,1 (da ) = paϕb,1 (y) = paϕb,1 (qb − oa ) = paϕb,1 (qb − da pa ).
hat equation gives da as a function of pa. If we assume the equa-
tion to be solved for the irst of the two variables, the equation takes 
the form
da = fa,1(pa ).


90 heory of exchange
his is precisely the equation of curve ad,1ap,1 of holder (1)’s demand 
for (A) in exchange for (B). hat equation would therefore be math-
ematically determinable if the equations r = ϕa,1 (q) and r = ϕb,1 (q) 
were themselves determinable; it is because they are not determin-
able that the equation da = fa,1(pa ) is empirical.
hat is the way to solve this problem: Given two commodities (A) 
and (B) and the utility or want curves of each exchanger for these 
two commodities, or the equations for these curves, and given the 
initial stock that each exchanger possesses, determine their demand 
curves, or their equations. It is instructive to present the formula of 
this solution in accordance with usual notation of the ininitesimal 
calculus.
ϕa,1 (q) and ϕb,1 (q) being the decreasing raretés of (A) and (B) for 
holder (1) of (B) as a function of the quantities consumed, the def-
inite integrals q ϕa,1(q) q
0

∫ d and q ϕa,1(q) q

0

∫ d are, as we have noted 
(§ 75), the efective utilities of those commodities for that holder as 
a function of the same commodities consumed. Ater the exchange 
of ob = da pa of (B) for da of (A), at a price pa of (A) in terms of (B); 
that is to say, with the quantities da of (A) and qb − ob = qb − da pa of 
(B), the total efective utility of the two commodities of the holder in 
question is

And this total efective utility attains its maximum when its deriva-
tive with respect to da is zero, that is, when
ϕa,1 (da ) − paϕb,1 (qb − da pa ) = 0,
or when
ϕa,1 (da ) = paϕb,1 (qb − da pa ). iv


Utility or want curves 91

82. our demonstration assumes that the want curves are continu-
ous; it is appropriate to examine the cases in which, among those 
curves, there are curves that are discontinuous. To be precise, there 
are three of these cases: one is the exchange of a commodity with a 
continuous curve for a commodity with a discontinuous curve; the 
second is the exchange of a commodity with a discontinuous curve 
for a commodity with a continuous curve; and the third is that of a 
commodity with a discontinuous curve for a commodity with a dis-
continuous curve. But, as we will see later, inasmuch as we choose a 
commodity to whose value we relate the values of all the others and 
with which all the others are purchased, and that can and must have 
a continuous want curve, it is permissible to restrict ourselves to the 
irst case.
As before, let βr,1βq,1 (Fig. 14) be the utility curve of (B) for the 
holder (1) of (B), and qb the quantity of (B) that he owns. And let a 
step-wise curve passing through the points a and a′″ be the utility 
curve of (A) for that exchanger. he commodity (A) is purchased 
only in whole units, and pa being its price in (B), the commodity (B) 
is sold only in quantities equal to pa . If the lengths dada′′ and dada′′′ 
represent the last unit bought and the irst unit not bought of (A), 
and if the lengths yy″ and yy′″ represent the last quantity sold and 
the irst quantity not sold of (B), when the exchanger has arrived at 
maximum satisfaction, two inequalities will obtain: area
yy″β″β < daa

v

and

area yy′″β′″β > da′′′a′′′.
Designating by m″ and m′′′ two lengths, the irst intermediate 
between yβ and y″β″, the other between yβ and y″β″, such that in 
multiplying them by yy″ = yy′″ = pa we obtain two areas yy″β″β 
and yy′″β′″β, which will be the average intensities of utility of the last 
quantity sold and of the irst quantity unsold of (B); we can set forth 


92 heory of exchange

the two inequalities, which, taken together, determine the demand da 
for (A), in the form
daa = pam″ + ε″,
da′′′a = pam′″ − ε′″.
From these two equations, it is easy to obtain
daa+ da a
″ + ′″ = +

″ − ′″
″ + ′″

′′′
m m pa m m

ε ε .
Now, m″ + m′″ is a magnitude very close to 2yβ, and ε″ − ε′″

m″ + m′″ is 
a fairly small magnitude. It therefore does not take much for it to be 
true that

hus, in the case of the exchange of a commodity that has a want 
curve that is continuous for a commodity that has a want curve that 
is discontinuous, when maximum satisfaction has been attained, 
what is (at least approximately) equal to the price is not the ratio of 
the intensities of the last wants satisied of the two commodities, but 
the ratio of the average of the intensities of the last want satisied and of 
the irst want not satisied of the commodity that is bought to the inten-
sity of the last want satisied of the commodity that is sold is (at least 
approximately) equal to the price.
We said approximately; because not only is it possible that the 
product pa × yβ of the price of (A) in terms of (B) by the intensity of 
the last want satisied of (B) is not equal to the average of the inten-
sities of the last want satisied and of the irst want unsatisied of (A), 
but it can even be greater or lesser than each of those two quantities. 
In fact, it is necessarily true that
area yy′′β′′β < pa × yβ
and
daa> area yy″β″β;
but it is not necessarily true that
daa > pa × yβ
and if, on the contrary,
daa< pa × yβ


94 heory of exchange
then daa and da′′′a′″ , which is < daa , will both be less than pa × yβ. 
Similarly, it is necessarily true that
area yy″′β″′β < pa × yβ
and that
da′′′a′″ < area yy′″β′″β;
but it is not necessarily true that
da′′′a′″ < pa × yβ;
and if, on the contrary,
da′′′a′″ > pa × yβ,
then da′′′a′″ and daa , which is > da′′′a′″ , will both be greater than 
pa × yβ.
83. Let us consider again the two inequalities
area yy′′β′′β < daa
area yy′″β′″β > da′′′a′″.
When pa decreases, the let-hand sides of these inequalities decrease. 
he irst inequality is not changed; but there comes a point at which 
the sign of the second inequality changes and da increases by at least 
one unit. When pa increases, the two irst members of the inequal-
ities increase. he second inequality is not changed, but there comes 
a point at which the sign of the irst inequality changes and da 
decreases by at least one unit. he demand curve for (A) is thus both 
descending and discontinuous.
Analytically, any price pa of (A) in terms of (B) being cried, 
according as our individual demands 1, 2,  units of (A) cor-
responding to wants with intensities r1,r2 , , thereby obtaining 


Utility or want curves 95
efective utilities of (A) measured by the same magnitudes r1,r2 , , 
will keep the quantities qb − pa , qb − 2pa ,  of (B) and give up the

price.

Notes
i In modern economic language, we use the terms ‘individual demand’ 
and ‘market demand’, but Walras used the terms ‘demande partielle’ and 
‘demande totale’. Properly translated, those expressions are obviously ‘par-
tial demand’ and ‘total demand’. Walras’s ‘total demand’ is the demands of 
all the traders in a speciic market aggregated together, and, of course, must 
not be confused with an economy-wide aggregate curve used in modern 
macroeconomics.
ii Walras’s use of the words ‘discontinuous’ and ‘continuous’ in the last 
two sentences is confusing. He means to say that the ‘step function’ 
βr,1 R′r″R″r″′R″′฀ changes into the ‘smooth function’ βr,1 r″r″′  βr,1. In 
fact, in the latter case, he certainly had in mind the notion of a diferenti-
able function.
iii Walras did not indicate the point B in Fig. 13, but in Fig. 12 it is clear which 
point is intended.

iv It was only in the fourth edition that Walras continued at this place with the 
examination of the second derivative of the above equation, namely
ϕa′,1(da ) + pa2ϕb′,1(qb − da pa ).
his second derivative is negative because the derivatives of the functions φ 
are assumed to be negative.
v In fact, this is a comparison of an area with a length, a procedure repeated 
in the equations below. Walras wants to say that the area in the let-hand 
member is less than the area of the rectangle with daa as horizontal side 
and da da′′ as vertical side. he length of the latter is 1.

LESSON 9

Discussion of demand curves. General 
formula for the mathematical solution of the 
problem of exchange of two commodities for 
each other

SUMMARy: – Demand at a zero price, demand then being equal 
to the extensive utility. Price at which there is no demand for (A). 
Price at which the supply of (B) is equal to the quantity possessed. 
Condition of supply equal to the quantity possessed: intersections 
of the quantity possessed and the demand curve; the hyperbola is 
the demand curve between the points of intersection. Decrease of 
the quantity possessed. Increase.
he general case is that of a holder of both commodities. Two 
equations or curves of partial efective demand. he equation 
or curve of demand for each commodity is also the equation or 
curve of supply of the same commodity as a function of the price. 
General system of equations of the dispositions to buy or sell com-
modities in the case of the exchange of two commodities for each 
other; solution of the equations.
84. Since the equation of partial demand
da = fa,1( pa )
is nothing other than the equation
ϕa,1 (da ) = paϕb,1 (qb − da pa ),
which is assumed to be solved with respect to da , we can discuss it as 
it appears in the latter form.


98 heory of exchange

First let pa = 0; the equation then reduces to
ϕa,1 (da ) = 0
the root of which is da = αq,1 = oad,1 [Fig. 15].
herefore: – Given two commodities in a market, when the price of 
one of them is zero, the quantity of that commodity demanded by each 
holder of the other will equal the quantity necessary for the satisfaction 
of all his wants for it, or, to the extensive utility.
his must be the case (§ 71). he curve a d,1a p,1 starts at the point 
αq,1.
85. Let us now assume that in the demand equation da = 0; we then 
obtain
ϕa,1 (0) = paϕb,1 (qb ),

be satisied by the quantity possessed of the commodity supplied.
his, too, must be the case, since now the last amount of (B) that 
holder (1) consumes, for example o
s

b , yields him the satisfaction

which is equal to or less than osb ρb.
86. Ater having noted the price condition that is necessary in order 
that our holder (1) of (B) does not demand any of (A), let us see how 
to express the price condition that is necessary for our holder not to 
retain any of (B). he equation must be stated that
ϕa,1 (da ) = paϕb,1 (qb − da pa ), [1]

 

da pa = qb . [2]
It then becomes
ϕa,1 (da ) = paϕb,1 (0), [3]

 

the root of which is pa = ϕ

herefore: – he quantity of one of the two commodities supplied 
by a holder of that commodity is equal to the quantity of it that he

possesses when the price of the commodity he demands in exchange is 
equal to or less than the ratio of the intensity of the last want that can 
be satisied by that commodity to the intensity of the maximum want 
satisied by the commodity supplied.
his is, again, what must be the case because the irst amount of (B) 
consumed by holder (1), for example, 

o

s

b , yields him no more than 

o

s

b

for d

87. In multiplying the two equations [2] and [3], member for mem-
ber, and dividing both sides by pa so as to eliminate the latter quan-
tity, we obtain
daϕa,1 (da ) = qbϕb,1 (0),
or, replacing qb, and ϕb,1 (0) by the lengths which represent them [in 
Fig. 15], namely oqb and oβr,1, we obtain
daϕa,1 (da ) = oqb × oβr,1.
his equation is an equation of condition that can be expressed in 
these terms: – In order that the supply of one of the two commodities can 
equal the quantity possessed of that commodity, it is necessary that there 
can be inscribed within the want curve of the commodity to be demanded 
a rectangle with an area equal to the area of a rectangle whose height is 
the quantity possessed of the commodity to be supplied and whose base 
is the intensity of the maximum want for that commodity.
Now, this condition is not always fulilled; notably, it is not ful-
illed in our example. We could, however, replace that condi-
tion with another. he system of equations [1] and [2] represents 


Discussion of demand curves 101

the intersection of the hyperbola of the quantity possessed of 
(B) da pa = qb, with the partial demand curve for (A), da = fa,1( pa ). 
hese two curves do not always meet; notably, they do not meet in 
the particular case of our holder.
88. his observation leads to another very important one. Assume 
that the equation of condition was satisied and that the demand 
curve [the dashed curve in Fig. 10] met the hyperbola of the quantity 
possessed at the points q′b and q′b′. he supply of (B) would be equal 
to the quantity possessed, qb, at prices represented by the abscissas 
of the points q′b and q′b′. It would also be equal at the intermediate 
prices. It seems, according to the combination of the equations or the 
curves, that, at the intermediate prices the supply of (B) must have 
been greater than qb , the quantity possessed of (B). But since a holder 
cannot supply more than the quantity he has, it is obviously neces-
sary to introduce the restriction that qb − da pa cannot be a negative 
quantity, which can be done by stating the condition in these terms: 
– In order that the supply of one of the two commodities be equal to 
the quantity possessed, the hyperbola of the quantity possessed and the 
demand curve of the other commodity must meet. Between the points 
of intersection, the hyperbola of the quantity possessed is the demand 
curve.
89. If, the curves αr,1αq,1 and βr,1βq,1 (Fig. 15) being invariant, qb 
happens to decrease, ρb increases, and consequently 

α

with the segments ad,1oπ of the coordinate axes.
herefore: – he utility of the two commodities being invariant for 
a holder of one of them, if the quantity possessed of that commodity 
happens to decrease, the point of intersection of the demand curve for 
the other commodity and the price axis approaches the origin of the 


102 heory of exchange

coordinate axes. When the quantity possessed is zero, the demand curve 
coincides with the part of the coordinate axes formed, on the demand 
axis, by the extensive utility of the commodity that will be demanded, 
and, on the price axis, by a length equal to the ratio of the maximum 
intensities of wants of the two commodities that will be demanded and 
supplied.
90. But contrariwise, if qb happens to increase, ρb decreases and 
consequently αr
b

ρ = Οap,1 increases. When qb = βq,1, then βb = 0, 

and the ratio α
 ρ

ap,1 from the point o then becomes ininite.

 

herefore: – he utility of the two commodities being invariant for 
a holder of one of them, if the quantity possessed of that commodity 
happens to increase, the point of intersection of the demand curve for 
the irst commodity and the price axis moves away from the origin of 
the coordinate axes. As soon as the quantity possessed becomes equal 
to its extensive utility, the demand curve becomes asymptotic to the 
price axis.
It is perfectly clear that this must be the case. It can be seen, more-
over, how truly we were right not to say anything prematurely about 
the form of the total demand curves (§ 55). We can now airm that 
they always intersect the demand axis, no commodity having an ini-
nite total extensive utility. But with respect to their being asymptotic 
to the price axis, it must be considered an ordinary and frequent fact, 
since it occurs as soon as, among the holders of a commodity, a single 
one of them owns a suicient quantity of it to satisfy all his wants for 
it. It follows that total supply curvesi most oten start at the origin.
91. We have always assumed up to this point that all our exchangers 
were holders of only one commodity, either commodity (A) or com-
modity (B). It is necessary, however, to take account of the case in 
which an individual is a holder of the two commodities (A) and (B), 
and to express mathematically that individual’s dispositions to trade. 
It is all the more necessary to do so in order to take full account of the 
possibilities, because the second case is the general case, from which 


Discussion of demand curves 103

the irst case is derived by assuming that one of the two quantities 
possessed is zero. We did not introduce it at the beginning of our 
study because of the complication that that would have introduced 
into our analysis, and we wanted to avoid consideration of the special 
case. But the theorem of maximum satisfaction permits us now to 
treat it in a simple and easy fashion.
Let us assume, therefore, that holder (1) of (B), having the same 
wants for (A) and (B) as before expressed by the two equations 
r = ϕa,1 (q) and r = ϕb,1 (q) of the want curves αr,1αq,1 and βr,1βq,1, 
instead of coming to the market with no (A) and a quantity qb of 
(B) represented by Οqb [Fig. 15], comes with a quantity qa,1 of (A) 
represented by Οqa,1, and a quantity qb,1 of (B) represented by Οqb,1 
[Fig. 16]; and we will see how to express his demand for (B) and his 
demand for (A) as functions of the prices pb and pa .
If, at a price pb of (B) in terms of (A), represented by the length qb,1pb , 
he demands a quantity db of (B), represented by the length qb,1db , he 
will have to supply a quantity oa of (A), represented by the length qa,1oa , 
such that there obtains, between pb, db, and oa , the equation
oa = db pb .
hen, the intensity of the last want satisied by (B) being rb , repre-
sented by the length dbβ , and the intensity of the last want satisied 
by (A) being ra, represented by the length oaα, we have, by virtue of 
the theorem of maximum satisfaction (§ 80),
rb = pbra ,
or, in replacing rb and ra by their values,
ϕb,1 (qb,1 + db ) = pbϕa,1 (qa,1 − oa ) = pbϕb,1 (qa,1 − db pb ), [1]

 

the equation of the demand curve of (B), bd,1bp,1 , as a function of the 
price of (B) in terms of (A), referred to the axes qb,1q and qb,1p.
Likewise, if, at a price pa of (A) in terms of (B), our man demands 
a quantity da of (A), he will have to supply a quantity ob of (B) such 
that there obtains, between pa , da , and ob, the equation

the equation of the demand curve of (A), ad,1ap,1 , as a function of the 
price of (A) in terms of (B), referred to the axes qa,1q and qa,1p.
92. he discussion of the two equations [1] and [2] for the various 
cases of demand at a zero price, of the price at which demand is zero, 
of when the quantity supplied equals the quantity possessed, of the 
decrease or increase of the quantities possessed, would be completely 
analogous to the preceding discussion. herefore I will not present 
such a discussion, except regarding a special point that it is essential 
to establish.
If, in equation [1], db = 0, that equation becomes
ϕb,1 (qb,1 ) = pbϕa,1 (qa,1 ).


Discussion of demand curves 105
Since it is always true that pa pb = 1, that equation can be written in 
the form
ϕa,1 (qa,1 ) = paϕb,1 (qb,1 ),
which would be the form we would obtain by setting da = 0 in 
equation [2].
herefore: – If the demand for one of the two commodities is zero at 
a certain price, the demand for the other commodity is also zero at the 
corresponding price.ii
93. hat proposition is only a corollary of a more general theorem.
To transform equation [1] of the demand for (B) as a function of 
the price of (B) in terms of (A) into an equation of the supply of (A) 
as a function of the price of (A) in terms of (B), it would suice to 
replace db by oa pa and pb by 1

pa . It would therefore become
ϕa,1 (qa,1 − oa ) = paϕb,1 (qb,1 + oa pa ),
which is nothing other than equation [2] in which da is replaced by 
−oa. In consequence, equation [2] of the demand for (A) is the equa-
tion of the supply of (A) for negative values of da. We could demon-
strate similarly that equation [1] for the demand for (B) becomes an 
equation of the supply of (B) for negative values of db. Now, prices 
being essentially positive, when db is positive, oa = db pb is positive, 
and consequently da = − oa is negative; and when db is negative, 
oa = dbpb is negative, and consequently da = − oa is positive. We could 
demonstrate similarly that, when da is positive, db is negative, and 
when da is negative, db is positive.
herefore: – If the demand for one of the two commodities is positive 
at a given price, the demand for the other is negative; that is to say, its 
supply is positive at the corresponding price.
And, in fact, a holder of the two commodities can only demand 
one of them by ofering the other in exchange, and reciprocally. It fol-
lows from this that if he neither demands nor supplies any quantity 


106 heory of exchange

of one of these commodities, he neither supplies nor demands any of 
the other. his, as is very easily seen, is the case in which, the ratio of 
the raretés of the two commodities being equal to the price, the real 
maximum utility is realized.
94. he curves [in Fig. 16] from ad,1 to ap,1 and from bd,1 to bp,1 are, 
therefore, demand curves, the [abscissas of the] points ap,1 and bp,1 
being reciprocals. he curves from ap,1 to ao,1 and from bp,1 to bo,1 
that are dotted and lie below the axes qa,1p and qb,1p in the diagram, 
are supply curves. Taken together and referred to the or axis, each of 
them is a curve of the total quantity retained and obtained of each of 
the two commodities as a function of the price. Each has a minimum 
corresponding to the maximum quantity supplied in exchange for 
the other commodity.
95. To sum up, if, more simply, we designate by x1 and y1 the posi-
tive or negative quantities of commodities (A) and (B) that exchan-
ger (1), having regard to the price, will add to the quantities qa,1 and 
qb,1 that he possesses, the dispositions to trade of that individual will 
result in the equation of exchange and the equation of maximum sat-
isfaction, namely
x1va + y1vb = 0,

from which we can eliminate y1 and solve for x1 as a function of pa, 
and eliminate x1 and solve for y1 as a function of pb. he formulas 
obtained in this way,
ϕa,1 (qa,1 + x1 ) = paϕb,1 (qb,1 − x1 pa ),
and


Discussion of demand curves 107
ϕb,1 (qb,1 + y1 ) = pbϕa,1 (qa,1 − y1 pb ),
are general formulas that we have only to suitably develop in order to 
express the dispositions to trade in the case of the exchange of several 
commodities for one another.
It is essential to note that for such values of pa as will render any 
negative x1 numerically larger than qa,1, the irst of the above two 
equations must be replaced by x1= − qa,1, and in that case the value of 
y1 would be given by the equation y1 pb = − qa,1; and that, similarly, for 
such values of pb as will render any negative y1 numerically greater 
than qb,1, the second of these equations must be replaced by y1= − qb,1, 
and in that case the value of x1 would be given by x 1pa = qb,1.
96. hese equations, solved for x1 and y1 and properly arranged so as 
to satisfy the above-mentioned restrictions, would take the form
x1 = fa,1 ( pa ), y1 = fb,1 (pb ).
Similarly, to express the dispositions to trade of exchangers (2), (3), 
, we would have
x2 = fa,2 ( pa ), y2 = fb,2 (pb ).
x3 = fa,3 (pa ), y3 = fb,3 ( pb ).
 
And the equality of the efective supply and of the efective demand 
of each of the two commodities (A) and (B) would be expressed by 
either one of the following equations:
X = fa,1 ( pa ) + fa,2 (pa ) + fa,3 (pa ) + = Fa (pa ) = 0,
Y = fb,1 ( pb ) + fb,2 ( pb ) + fb,3 ( pb ) + = Fb ( pb ) = 0.


108 heory of exchange
For example, we could derive pa from the irst equation and pb 
from the equation
pa pb = 1;
and this value of pb would necessarily satisfy the second equation 
because obviously
Xva + Yvb = 0,
from which it follows that, if for a certain value of pa, Fa (pa )= 0, 
then for the corresponding value of pb we have Fb (pb )= 0.
his solution is analytical. We could present it geometrically. he 
sum of the positive xs would yield the demand curve of (A), and 
the sum of the positive ys the demand curve of (B). From these two 
demand curves, the two supply curves of the two commodities can 
be deduced, which are nothing other than the sums of the negative 
xs and the negative ys taken positively. he intersection of these two 
curves would determine the current prices.
97. hat would be the mathematical solution. he solution in the 
marketplace would be efectuated in the following manner:
Any two prices that are reciprocals of each other, pa and pb, being 
cried, x1, x2 , x3 , y1, y2 , y3 ,… would be mutually determined with-
out mathematics, but nevertheless in conformity with the condition 
of maximum satisfaction. X and Y would be determined under the 
same condition. If X = 0, then also Y = 0, and the prices would be 
equilibrium prices. But generally X  0, and consequently Y  0. he 
irst inequality can be put into the form
Da Oa
in which Da designates the sum of the positive xs and Oa the sum of 
the negative xs taken positively. hen it is a question of bringing Da 
and Oa into equality.
In regard to Da , this quantity is positive when pa = 0; it decreases 
indeinitely if pa increases; and it is zero for a certain value of pa 
somewhere between zero and ininity. As for Oa, that quantity is 


Discussion of demand curves 109

zero when pa = 0, and even for certain positive values of pa; then 
it increases if pa increases, but not indeinitely: it passes through at 
least one maximum and then decreases if pa continues to increase; 
and it is zero if pa = ∞. In these conditions, and if Da does not fall to 
zero before Οa ceases to be zero, in which case there is no solution, 
there exists at least one value of pa at which Oa and Da are equal. To 
ind this value, it is necessary to increase pa if Da > Oa, and decrease 
pa if Da < Oa. We recognize the law of efective supply and demand.

LESSON 10

Rareté, or the cause of value in exchange

SUMMARy: – Analytic deinition of the exchange of two com-
modities for each other. Proportionality of values in exchange to 
raretés. Qualiication relative to the case of discontinuity of want 
curves. Qualiication relative to the case of zero demand, and of 
supply equal to the quantity possessed. Rareté, the cause of value 
in exchange. Value in exchange, a relative fact; rareté, an absolute 
fact. here are only individual raretés. Average rareté. Variation 
of the prices of two commodities, each in terms of the other; four 
causes of variation; possibility of verifying these causes. Law of the 
variation of equilibrium prices.
98. Ater due consideration, it becomes clear that the utility curves 
and the quantities possessed are the necessary and suicient elements 
for the determination of current or equilibrium prices. From these 
elements, there result mathematically, in the irst place, the curves of 
partial and total demand, because of the fact that each holder tries 
to obtain the greatest possible satisfaction of his wants. And from 
these partial and total demand curves, there result mathematically, 
in the second place, the current or equilibrium prices, because of the 
fact that there can be only one price in the market, that at which 
total efective demand equals total efective supply; otherwise stated, 
because each must receive in proportion to what he gives, or must 
give in proportion to what he receives.
hus: – he exchange of two commodities for each other in a freely 
competitive market is an operation by which all holders of either one, 
or of both, of the two commodities can obtain the greatest satisfaction 
of their wants consistent with the condition of giving the commodity 


Rareté, or the cause of value in exchange 111

that they sell and receiving the commodity that they buy in a common 
and identical proportion.
he principal object of the theory of social wealth is to generalize 
this proposition by showing that it applies to the exchange of several 
commodities for one another just as it does to the exchange of two 
commodities for each other, and that it applies to free competition 
in production just as it does to exchange. he principal object of the 
theory of production of social wealth is to trace its consequences by 
showing how the rule of organization of agriculture, manufacturing, 
and commerce is deduced from it. We can say, therefore, that it con-
tains the germ of all theoretical and applied economics.


It should be noted that, if it is a question of commodities that are 
naturally consumed in whole units and that have discontinuous util-
ity curves, we will have to put into the tables of raretés, underlining 
them in order to make them distinguishable, proportional terms that 
would be, we have seen (§ 82), very close, not to the intensities of the 
last wants satisied, but to the averages of the intensities of the last 
wants satisied and of the irst wants unsatisied.
It is also possible that one of the two terms may be missing one or 
several of the ratios of the raretés. hus, it can happen, for example, 
that at the price pa holder (2) does not demand (A); then there 
would be no rareté of (A) for holder (2) because it would not sat-
isfy any want for him, and the term ra,2 would have to be replaced 
by parb,2, which would be greater than the intensity of the irst want 
for (A) that this holder experiences (§ 85). It can also happen, for 
example, that holder (3), at the price pa , demands all the (A) he 
can get at any possible price; that is to say, becomes a supplier of 
the quantity he possesses of (B); then there would be no rareté of 
(B) for him, because it would not satisfy any want for him, and the 
term rb,3 would have to be replaced by a term pbra,3 greater than the 
intensity βr,3 of the irst want for (B) that this holder experiences 
(§ 87). We could agree to introduce the terms parb,2 and pbra,3 into 
the above tables, putting them in parentheses, which would revert 


Rareté, or the cause of value in exchange 113

to deining rareté as the intensity of the last want that is or that could 
have been satisied.
Subject to those two reservations, we may set forth the following 
proposition:
Current prices or equilibrium prices are equal to the ratios of the raretés.
In other words:
Values in exchange are proportional to the raretés.

100. We have arrived here, in regard to the exchange of two commod-
ities for each other, at the goal we set for ourselves at the beginning of 
this mathematical theory of exchange (§ 40), namely to arrive at rareté 
by beginning with value in exchange, instead of arriving at value in 
exchange by beginning with rareté as we did in the irst part devoted 
to the object and divisions of economics. In fact, rareté as we present 
it here, that is to say, the intensity of the last want satisied, is precisely 
rareté as we have deined it earlier (§ 21) by the double condition of 
utility and limitation in quantity. here could not be a last want sat-
isied if there were no want; that is to say, if a commodity had neither 
extensive nor intensive utility, if it were useless. And the intensity of 
the last want satisied would be zero if the commodity, having a utility 
curve, existed in a quantity greater than the extensive utility, as would 
be the case, for example, if it were unlimited in quantity. our present 
rareté is therefore the same as our former rareté. he only additional 
aspects are that it is conceived to be a measurable magnitude, and 
that value in exchange not only necessarily follows and accompanies 
it but also is measured by it. Now, if it is certain that rareté and value 
in exchange are two concomitant and proportional phenomena, it is 
certain that rareté is the cause of value in exchange.
Value in exchange is a relative fact; rareté is an absolute fact. If, 
of the two commodities, (A) and (B), one of them became useless, 
or, though remaining useful, became unlimited in quantity, it would 
no longer be scarce and would no longer have value in exchange. 
In this case, the other commodity would also cease to have value 
in exchange, but it would not cease to be scarce; it would even be 
more scarce or less scarce, it would have such and such a determinate 
rareté, for each of the holders of the commodity.


114 heory of exchange

I say, ‘for each of the holders of this commodity’. And, in fact, it 
is essential to state once more: there is no such thing as the rareté 
of commodity (A) or of commodity (B), no such thing either, con-
sequently, as the ratio of the rareté of (A) to the rareté of (B), or as 
the ratio of the rareté of (B) to the rareté of (A); there are rather the 
raretés of the commodity (A) or the commodity (B) for holders (1), 
(2), (3),  of these two commodities, and the ratios of the raretés of 
(A) to the raretés of (B), or of the ratios of the raretés of (B) to the 
raretés of (A) for those holders. Rareté, it can be said, is personal. It is 
only with respect to such and such an individual that we can deine 
rareté by rigorously establishing the parallelism of, on the one hand, 
rareté, efective utility, and quantity possessed, and, on the other hand, 
velocity, distance traveled, and time taken to travel it. hus, the deriva-
tive of efective utility with respect to the quantity possessed is deined 
exactly as velocity is deined: the derivative of distance traveled with 
respect to the time taken to travel it.
If we wanted to deine something that we might call the rareté of 
commodity (A) or of commodity (B), it would be necessary to take 
the average rareté, which would be the arithmetical average of the 
raretés of each of those commodities for each of the exchangers ater 
trading, a conception that would be no more extraordinary than that 
of the average height or average longevity in a given country and that 
could be useful in certain cases. hese average raretés would them-
selves be proportional to the values in exchange.
101. It is the right of the theorist to assume that the determinants 
of prices are invariant during the period he speciies in his formu-
lation of the law of the establishment of equilibrium prices. But it is 
his duty, once this operation has been completed, to remember that 
the determinants of prices are essentially variable, and consequently 
to formulate the law of the variation of equilibrium prices. his now 
remains to be done here. And, furthermore, the irst operation leads 
immediately to the second. Indeed, the determinants of the estab-
lishment of prices are also the determinants of the variation of prices. 
hese determinants of the establishment of prices are the utilities of 
the commodities and the quantities possessed of the commodities. 
hese forces are, therefore, the primary causes and conditions of the 
variation of prices.


Rareté, or the cause of value in exchange 115

Let us assume that, in the same market where (A) and (B) were 
traded initially at the above-mentioned current prices, 1
µ

 of (A) in 
terms of (B) and µ of (B) in terms of (A), that trading now takes 
place at the diferent current prices 1

 µ′ of (A) in terms of (B) and µ′ 
of (B) in terms of (A); then we can state that this change in price is 
the result of one of the following four causes, or of several of them, 
or even of all of them:
1. A change in the utility of commodity (A);
2. A change in the quantity of that commodity possessed by one 
or several holders;
3. A change in the utility of commodity (B);
4. A change in the quantity of that commodity possessed by one 
or several holders.
hese circumstances are absolute and could be identiied if neces-
sary. Practically, this identiication could prove to be more or less 
diicult; but nothing obliges us to declare it theoretically impossible. 
An investigation in which all the exchangers would be interrogated 
successively regarding the determinants of their partial demand 
curves would clarify the matter. one can even conceive of a case in 
which the primary cause of a variation of a price imposes itself in 
one way or other on the attention of the observer. For example, if it 
is assumed that a rise in price from µ to µ′ occurs at the same time as 
the discovery of a remarkable property of commodity (B), or of an 
accident that would have partially destroyed the supply of that com-
modity, we could not have done otherwise than to associate one or 
the other of those two events with the rise in price. Now, it is clear 
that the association that one makes, sometimes despite oneself, is not 
impossible in fact, and that is how the investigation of the primary 
causes and conditions of variations in prices is conducted.
102. Let it be assumed that equilibrium is established and that the 
exchangers possess the quantities of (A) and (B) that, at the recipro-
cal prices 

1
µ of (A) in terms of (B) and µ of (B) in terms of (A), yield 


116 heory of exchange

them maximum satisfaction. his condition is fulilled because of the 
equality of the ratios of the raretés to the prices; it no longer holds 
true if that equality ceases to exist. Let us see, then, how variations 
in utility and in the quantity possessed disturb the state of maximum 
satisfaction and what the consequences of the disturbance are.
As for the variations in utility, they can occur in very diverse ways: 
there may be an increase in intensive utility and a decrease in exten-
sive utility or vice versa, etc. We must, therefore, take some care as 
to how we enunciate general propositions in this respect. hat is why 
we will reserve the expressions increase in utility and decrease in util-
ity for shits in the want curve that have the result of increasing or 
decreasing the intensity of the last want satisied, or, the rareté, ater 
exchange occurs. his being understood, we assume an increase in 
the utility of (B); that is to say, a shit in the want curve of (B) result-
ing in an increase in the rareté of (B) for certain parties. hese indi-
viduals will no longer obtain maximum satisfaction. on the contrary, 
they will ind it to their advantage to demand (B) by ofering some of 
their (A) at the current reciprocal prices µ1 and µ. herefore, since 
the supply was equal to the demand for each of the two commodities 
at the prices 1
µ

 and µ, there will now be, at these prices, an excess of 
demand over supply of (B) and an excess of supply over demand of 
(A). he result will be a rise in pb and a fall in pa . But there will no 
longer be a maximum of satisfaction for the other exchangers. on the 
contrary, it will be advantageous for them, at a price of (B) in terms 
of (A) greater than µ and at a price of (A) in terms of (B) less than  
1
µ

, to supply (B) and demand (A). Equilibrium will be re-established 
when, at a price of (B) higher than µ and at a price of (A) lower than 
1
µ

, the demand and supply of the two commodities are equated. hus 
an increase in the utility of (B) for our individuals will have had the 
result of an elevation of the price of (B).
A decrease in the utility of (B) would obviously have had the result 
of a reduction of the price of (B).


Rareté, or the cause of value in exchange 117

It is suicient to look at the want curves to see that an increase 
in the quantity possessed results in a decrease in rareté, and that a 
decrease in the quantity possessed results in an increase in rareté. 
Moreover, we have just seen that as rareté decreases or increases, 
price decreases or increases. Consequently, the efects of changes 
in the quantity possessed are purely and simply the opposite of the 
efects of changes in utility, and we can now enunciate the law we 
have been looking for in the following terms:
– Two commodities being given in a state of equilibrium in a market, if, all 
other things being equal, the utility of one of these two commodities increases 
or decreases for one or more of the exchangers, the value of that commodity in 
relation to the value of the other, or, its price, increases or decreases.
If, all other things being equal, the quantity of one of the two commodities 
possessed by one or more holders increases or decreases, the price of that com-
modity decreases or increases.
We remark, before going beyond this subject, that, although the 
change of prices necessarily indicates a variation in the determinants 
of the prices, on the other hand, constancy of the prices does not 
necessarily indicate constancy of the determinants of these prices. In 
fact, we can, without another demonstration, also enunciate the fol-
lowing double proposition:
– Two commodities being given, if the utility and the quantity of one of 
these two commodities possessed by one or more exchangers or holders vary in 
such a way that their raretés do not change, then the value of this commodity 
with respect to the value of the other, or, its price, does not vary.
If the utility and the quantity of the two commodities possessed by one or 
more exchangers or holders vary in such a way that the ratios of their raretés 
do not vary, then the prices of the two commodities do not vary.

103. It is now a question of passing from the study of the exchange 
of two commodities (A) and (B) to the study of several commodities 
(A), (B), (C), (D),  for one another. To do this, it will suice that 
we generalize appropriately our formulas, irst making the replace-
ments in the case in which the exchangers are holders of only one 
commodity.
Henceforth, we shall denote by Da,b the efective demand of (A) 
in terms of (B), by pa,b the price of (A) in terms of (B), by Db,a the 
efective demand of (B) in terms of (A), and by pb,a the price of (B) 


he problem of the exchange of several commodities 119

in terms of (A). For the four unknowns Da,b, Db,a, pa,b, pb,a we have 
two equations of efective demand:
Da,b = Fa,b (pa,b ),
Db,a = Fb,a (pb,a ),
and two equations of equality of efective supply and demand:
Db,a = Da,b pa,b ,
Da,b = Db,a pb,a .
We know that the irst two equations can be represented geomet-
rically by two curves, and the last two by inscribing in these curves 
two rectangles with bases that are inversely equal to the ratio of their 
heights and directly equal to the ratio of their surfaces (§ 57).i
104. Let us now pass from the case of two commodities (A) and (B) to 
the case of three commodities (A), (B) and (C). To that end, we will 
depict a market where, from one side, enter people who own com-
modity (A) and who are ready to give up a part of it to obtain (B), 
and a part to obtain (C); from another side, people arrive who own 
commodity (B) and who are ready to give up a part of it to obtain 
(A), and a part to obtain (C); from another side, inally, people arrive 
who own commodity (C) and who are ready to give up a part of it to 
obtain (A), and a part to obtain (B).
hat having been posited, selecting from all those people, an owner 
of (B), for instance, and developing our preceding reasoning accord-
ingly, we will see, here too, that this individual’s dispositions to bid 
can be rigorously determined.
Indeed, each owner of a quantity qb of commodity (B) who comes 
to the market to exchange a certain quantity ob,a of this commodity 
for a quantity da,b of commodity (A), in accordance with the equa-
tion of exchange
da,bva = ob,avb ,


120 heory of exchange
and a certain quantity ob,c of this same commodity for a quantity dc,b 
of commodity (C) in accordance with the equation of exchange
dc,bvc = ob,cvb ,
will come back from the market with a quantity da,b of (A), a quantity 
dc,b of (C), and a quantity
y q o o q d v

v
a b a b c b a b v

 or pa,b, da , v
v

c
b

 or pc ,b,

 

dc ,b , and y there will always be the relationship
qb = y + da,b pa,b + dc,b pc,b .
our individual does not know, before having entered the market, 
what v
v

a
b

 or pa,b and v
v

c
b

 or pc,b will be; but he is sure that he will know 
them as soon as he enters into the market, and that, these values of 
pa,b and pc,b being known, he will accept, as a result, a value of da,b 
and a value of dc,b , from which inally will result a certain value of y 
in accordance with the above equation. Most certainly, we are forced 
to recognize that da, b cannot be determined without knowing pc,b in 
addition to pa,b, nor can we determine dc,b without knowing pa,b in 
addition to pc,b . But we are also forced to accept that, pa,b and pc,b 
being known, da,b and dc,b can be determined because of that very 
circumstance.
105. Now, here again, nothing is simpler than expressing mathemat-
ically the direct relation of da,b and dc,b, that is, the efective demand 
of (A) and (C) in terms of (B), with pa,b and pc,b , that is, with the price 
of these commodities. his relation, corresponding to the disposi-
tions to bid of our individual, will be completely expressed by the 


he problem of the exchange of several commodities 121
two equations da,b = fa,b (pa,b , pc,b ) and dc,b = fc,b (pa,b , pc,b ). We would 
obtain in the same way the equations expressing the dispositions to 
bid of all the other holders of (B); and, inally, by purely and sim-
ply adding these partial demand equations, we would obtain the two 
equations of total demand:
Da,b = Fa,b (pa,b , pc,b ),
Dc,b = Fc,b (pa,b , pc,b ),
expressing the dispositions to bid of all the holders of (B).
Likewise, we would have the two equations of total demand:
Da,c = Fa,c (pa,c , pb,c ),
Db,c = Fb,c (pa,c , pb,c ),
expressing the dispositions to bid of all the holders of (C).
Finally, we would likewise have the two equations of total 
demand:
Db,a = Fb,a (pb,a , pc,a ),
Dc,a = Fc,a (pb,a , pc,a ),
expressing the dispositions to bid of all the holders of (A).
106. Moreover, we have the two equations of exchange
Db,a = Da,b pa,b ,Db,c = Dc,b pc,b ,
of (B) for (A) and (C).
We have the two equations of exchange
Dc,a = Da,c pa,c ,Dc,b = Db,c pb,c
of (C) for (A) and (B).
Finally, we have the two equations of exchange


122 heory of exchange
Da,b = Db,a pb,a ,Da,c = Dc,a pc,a
of (A) for (B) and (C).
Hence, we have in all 12 equations in the 12 unknowns that are 
the 6 prices of the three commodities in terms of one another, and 
the 6 total quantities of the three commodities exchanged for one 
another.
107. Let there now be m commodities (A), (B), (C), (D),  in a mar-
ket; it is clear that by virtue of reasoning exactly the same as was 
developed for the case of two commodities and for the case of three 
commodities, and that is unnecessary to repeat once more, we can 
set forth the m – 1 equations of efective demand of (B), (C), (D),  
in terms of (A):
Db,a = Fb,a ( pb,a , pc,a , pd,a ,),
Dc,a = Fc,a ( pb,a , pc,a , pd,a ,),
Dd,a = Fd,a (pb,a , pc,a , pd,a ,),



the m – 1 equations of efective demand of (A), (C), (D),  in terms 
of (B):
Da,b = Fa,b ( pa,b , pc,b , pd,b ,),
Dc,b = Fc,b ( pa,b , pc,b , pd,b ,),
Dd,b = Fd,b (pa,b , pc,b , pd,b ,),



the m – 1 equations of efective demand of (A), (B), (D),  in terms 
of (C):
Da,c = Fa,c ( pa,c , pb,c , pd,c ,),


he problem of the exchange of several commodities 123
Db,c = Fb,c ( pa,c , pb,c , pd,c ,),
Dd,c = Fd,c (pa,c , pb,c , pd,c ,),



the m – 1 equations of efective demand of (A), (B), (C),  in terms 
of (D):
Da,d = Fa,d (pa,d , pb,d , pc,d ,),
Db,d = Fb,d (pa,d , pb,d , pc,d ,),
Dc,d = Fc,d (pa,d , pb,d , pc,d ,),


and so forth; hence, in all m(m – 1) equations.
108. Furthermore, it is obvious that without further explanation we 
can set forth the m – 1 equations of exchange of (A) for (B), (C), 
(D), 
Da,b = Db,a pb,a ,Da,c = Dc,a pc,a , Da,d = Dd,a pd,a , ,
the m – 1 equations of exchange of (B) for (A), (C), (D), 
Db,a = Da,b pa,b ,Db,c = Dc,b pc,b , Db,d = Dd,b pd,b , ,
the m – 1 equations of exchange of (C) for (A), (B), (D), 
Dc,a = Da,c pa,c ,Dc,b = Db,c pb,c , Dc,d = Dd,c pd,c , ,
the m – 1 equations of exchange of (D) for (A), (B), (C), 
Dd,a = Da,d pa,d ,Dd,b = Db,d pd,b , Dd,c = Dc,d pc,d , ,
and so forth; hence, in all m(m – 1) equations.


124 heory of exchange

hese m(m – 1) equations of exchange form, together with the 
m(m – 1) equations of efective demand, a system of in all 2m(m – 1)  
equations. Now, we have precisely 2m(m – 1) unknowns; indeed, for 
the m commodities exchanged for one another there are m(m – 1)  
prices and m(m – 1) quantities exchanged in all.
109. In the special case of the exchange of two goods for each other, 
and in that of the exchange of three goods for one another, the prob-
lem can be solved either geometrically or algebraically, because, in 
those two cases the demand functions can themselves be represented 
geometrically. In the irst case, the demand functions are functions 
of one variable and therefore can be represented by two curves. In 
the second case, these functions are functions of two variables and 
therefore can be represented by six surfaces. A simple inscription of 
rectangles under the two curves, in the irst case, and an inscription 
of rectangles under the curves that can be obtained by the intersec-
tion of the surfaces by planes, in the second case, thus gives us the 
geometrical solution of the problem.
In the general case, on the contrary, the demand functions are 
functions of m – 1 variables that cannot be represented in three-
dimensional space. hat is why, in this case, the problem can be con-
sidered as amenable to being posed and solved mathematically, but 
not geometrically. Let us recall, moreover, that we do not have to do 
here with posing and solving the problem in reality in any given case, 
but only of conceiving scientiically the nature of the problem that 
presents itself and is solved empirically in the market. Now, from this 
point of view, the algebraic solution is not only just as valuable as the 
geometric one, but it may even be said that in adopting the analytical 
form, we adopt the general and scientiic form par excellence.
110. he problem of the exchange of several commodities against one 
another seems to be solved. However, it is only half solved. Under the 
conditions deined above, we would undoubtedly, in the market, have 
a certain equilibrium of the prices of the commodities taken two at 
a time; but this would be only an imperfect equilibrium. he perfect 
or general market equilibrium occurs only if the prices of any two com-
modities in terms of each other are equal to the ratio of the price of each 
one in terms of any third commodity. his has to be demonstrated. To 


he problem of the exchange of several commodities 125

do so, from all the commodities we take three, (A), (B) and (C), for 
example; we assume that the price pc ,b is greater than the ratio of the 
prices pc ,a and pb,a, and let us see what will happen.
We will imagine, to ix our ideas, that the place that serves as the 
market for the exchange of all the commodities (A), (B), (C), (D),  
for one another be divided in just as many parts as there are exchanges 
of two commodities for each other, hence into m(m −1)

2 special mar-
kets indicated by signboards on which are mentioned the names of 
the commodities that are exchanged and the exchange prices deter-
mined by means of the equations above. Hence: – ‘Exchange of (A) for  
(B) and of (B) for (A) at prices pa,b and pb,a.’ – ‘Exchange of (A) 
for (C) and of (C) for (A) at prices pa,c and pc ,a.’ – ‘Exchange of (B) 
for (C) and of (B) for (C) at prices pb,c and pc ,b.’ – Having posited 
this, if each holder of (A) who wants (B) and (C) exchanged his 
(A) for (B) and (C) only in the irst two special markets mentioned 
above, if each holder of (B) who wants (A) and (C) exchanged his (B) 
for (A) and (C) only in the irst and the third special market, and if 
each holder of (C) who wants (A) and (B) exchanged his (C) for (A) 
and (B) only in the last two special markets, the equilibrium would 
be maintained as it is. But is to easy to show that neither the holders 
of (A), nor those of (B), nor those of (C) will adopt this method of 
exchange; they will proceed in quite another way, which will be more 
advantageous to them.
111. Let us therefore assume that

hence
pc,b pb,a pa,c ,

α being, irst of all, greater than 1.


126 heory of exchange

From this equation, it follows that the true price of (C) in terms 
of (B) is not pc,b, but 

pc,b
α , because with 

pc,b
α of (B) we have 

pc,b pb,a
α of 

(A), at the price pb,a = 1
pa,b

 of (A) in terms of (B) in the market (A, B);  

and for pc,b pb,a
α

 of (A) we have pc,b pb,a pa,c
α

 = 1 of (C) at the price 

pc, a = 1

pa,c

 of (C) in terms of (A) in the market (A, C).
It follows also that the true price of (B) in terms of (A) is not pb,a, 
but pb,a
α

, because with pb,a
α

 of (A) we have pb,a pa,c
α

 of (C), at the price 

pc, a = 1
pa,c

 of (C) in terms of (A) in the market (A, C); and for pb,a pa,c
α 
of (C) we have pb,a pa,c pc,b
α

 = 1 of (B) at the price pb,c = 1
pc ,b

 of (B) in 

terms of (C) in the market (B, C).
Finally, it follows also that the true price of (A) in terms of (C) is 
not pa,c , but pa,c
α

, because with pa,c
α

 of (C) we have pa,c pc,b
α

 of (B), at 

the price pb,c = 1
pc ,b

 of (B) in terms of (C) in the market (B, C); and 

for pa,c pc,b
α

 of (B) we have pa,c pc,b pb,a
α

 = 1 of (A) at the price pa,b = 

1
pb,a

 of (A) in terms of (B) in the market (A, B).

112. Taking concrete numbers to clarify this point, we assume that 
pc,b = 4, pc ,a = 6, pb,a = 2; this yields α = 1.33.
It follows from the equationii

that the true price of (C) in terms of (B) is not 4, but 4

with 3 of (B) we have 3 × 2 = 6 of (A), at the price of 1

of (B) in the market (A, B); and for 6 of (A) we have 6 1

at the price of 6 of (C) in terms of (A) in the market (A, C).
It follows also that the true price of (B) in terms of (A) is not 2, but

113. he holders of (A), of (B), of (C) obviously will not hesitate to 
substitute commodities in this way: the irst group, indirect exchange 
of (A) for (C) and of (C) for (B) instead of direct exchange of (A) for 
(B); the second group, indirect exchange of (B) for (A) and of (A) for 
(C) instead of direct exchange of (B) for (C); the third group, indirect 
exchange of (C) for (B) and of (B) for (A) instead of direct exchange 
of (C) for (A). his indirect exchange is called arbitrage. As for the 
savings they will obtain in this way, they will distribute them over 
their needs just as they please, by giving themselves a supplement of 
this or that commodity to procure the greatest possible total satis-
faction. We could have shown that the condition for this maximum 
would be that the ratios of the intensities of the last needs be equal to 


128 heory of exchange

the real prices resulting from this arbitrage. However, without enter-
ing into these considerations, it suices for us to remark that this 
supplementary demand will take place, just as the principal demand: 
for the holders of (A), by exchanging (A) for (C) and (C) for (B), 
but never (A) for (B); for the holders of (B), by exchanging (B) for 
(A) and (A) for (C), but never (B) for (C); for the holders of (C), by 
exchanging (C) for (B) and (B) for (A), but never (C) for (A). Hence, 
in the market (A, B), there will always be demand for (A) and supply 
of (B), but no demand for (B) and no supply of (A); hence pb,a will 
decrease. In the market (A, C) there will always be a demand for (C) 
and a supply of (A), but no demand for (C) or supply of (A); hence 
pc ,a will increase. In the market (B, C) there will always be a demand 
for (B) and a supply of (C), but no demand for (C) or supply of (B); 
hence pc ,b will decrease.
114. It is clear that, in the case where pc,b > p
p

c a
b a

,

,

, the market equilibrium 
is not deinitive or general, and that arbitrages take place resulting in a 
decrease of pc ,b, an increase of pc,a , and a decrease of pb,a. At the same 
time, it is clear that in the case that pc ,b < p
p

c a
b a

,

,

, there will be arbitrage 
in the market with as a result an increase of pc ,b, a decrease of pc ,a 
and an increase of pb,a. Indeed, we would then have

hence
αpb,c pc,a pa,b = 1,
with α < 1; from this, it would follow that the true price of (B) in 
terms of (C) would be αpb,c , if (C) is exchanged for (A) and (A) for 
(B), that the true price of (A) in terms of (B) would be αpa,b , if (B) 
is exchanged for (C) and (C) for (A); and that the true price of (C) 
in terms of (A) would be αpc,a, if (A) is exchanged for (B) and (B) 
for (C). Moreover, it is quite clear that what has been said about the 


he problem of the exchange of several commodities 129

prices of (A), (B), and (C) can also be said about the prices of any 
three commodities. If, therefore, it is desired that arbitrage not take 
place and that the equilibrium of the commodities two by two in the 
market be general, the condition must be introduced that the price 
of one of any two commodities in terms of the other must be equal 
to the ratio of the price of the one to the price of the other, in terms 
of any arbitrary third commodity; that is to say, that the following

that our preceding system of demand equations and equations of

exactly what happens in the case of a substitution in place of special 
markets of one general market by means of the substitution in place 
of the equations of exchange, expressing the equality of the demand 
for and supply of each commodity in exchange for each of the other 
ones separately, of the following equations of exchange expressing

If, then, we add the last m – 1, ater having multiplied the two mem-

the third by pd , and so forth, and having eliminated on both sides 
the identical terms, we come back to the irst equation of the system. 
his irst one can therefore be neglected and the system reduced to 
the m – 1 subsequent equations. hese remain then m – 1 equations 
of exchange that, combined with m(m – 1) demand equations and the 
(m – 1)(m – 1) equations of general equilibrium, form in all 2m(m – 1)  
equations whose roots are the m(m – 1) prices of the commodities 
in one another and the m(m – 1) total quantities of the commodities 
exchanged for one another. It is in this way, the demand equations

remains only to demonstrate, and this is the essential point, that this 
selfsame problem of exchange of which we just have furnished the 
theoretical solution is also the problem that is solved practically in 
the market by the mechanism of free competition. However, before 
carrying out this demonstration, we will move on to the case in which 
the exchangers to the exchange are holders of several commodities, 
which is the general case, a simple and easy treatment of which is 
enabled by the theorem of maximum satisfaction.

supply and demand in accordance with the variation of the price

demand is greater than supply and decrease them when supply is 
greater than demand. 
116. In the case of the exchange of an arbitrary number of com-
modities, similar to the case of the exchange of two commodities 
for each other, the equations of partial efective demand are deter-
mined mathematically by the condition of the maximum satisfaction  
of wants. What then is this condition? It is, as always, that the ratio 
of the rareté s of the two commodities be equal to the price of the one 
in terms of the other; otherwise an advantageous exchange between 
the two exchangers would still be possible (§ 80). If the exchangers 


Solution of the problem of the exchange of several commodities 133

in the exchange are holders of only a single commodity, and, bearing 
in mind allowing arbitrage to take place, if  m(m – 1) prices of the 
m commodities are cried two by two not subject to the condition 
of general equilibrium, maximum satisfaction will be achieved, for 
each exchanger, when the ratios of the rareté s of the commodities 
demanded to the rareté  of the commodity of which he is a holder 
are equal, not to the cried prices, but to the true prices obtained by 
arbitrage. But if the exchangers are holders of several commodities, 
and if, on the contrary, in order to prevent arbitrage from occurring, 
the m – 1 prices of  m – 1 of the commodities are cried in terms of 
the m th, taken as numeraire, it being understood that the price of 
one of any two commodities in terms of the other will be equal to 
the ratio of the price of the one commodity to the price of the other 
in numeraire, it is obvious that maximum satisfaction will occur for 
each exchanger when the ratios of the rareté s of the commodities 
other than the numeraire and the rareté  of the numeraire commodity 
are equal to the cried prices. 

117.  Let therefore exchanger (1) be the holder of qa,1 of (A), qb,1 of 
(B), qc,1 of (C), qd,1 of (D), . Let rrrrrrrrrrr = ϕ , (qqqqqqqqqqq), rrrrrrrrrrr = ϕ , (qqqqqqqqqqq), rrrrrrrrrrr = ϕ , (qqqqqqqqqqq),

respective prices of the commodities (B), (C), (D),  in terms of 
(A). And let xxxxx11, yyyyy11,zzzzz111,wwwww111, be the respective quantities of (A), (B), 
(C), (D),   that exchanger (1) will add to the quantities qa,1, qb,1, qc,1,

tities xxxxx11, yyyyy11,zzzzz111,wwwww111, can be positive, representing then quantities 
demanded; and they can be negative, representing quantities sup-

some are positive and others are negative, and that, generally speak-

In this way, the dispositions to bid of all the exchangers to the

various commodities and the quantities of the commodities pos-

observation must be made.

pppppbb , pppppcc , pd ,: this is the case in which exchanger (1) supplies

not keep commodity (B) for himself. Introducing this value of y1 into

his equation is a condition that can be translated into these 
words: – In order that the supply of one of the commodities can be 
equal to the quantity possessed of the commodity, i it must be possible 
to inscribe, in the portion of the area of the want curves of the com-
modities that are demanded that is above the portion representing the 
wants satisied by the quantity possessed, rectangles the sum of which 
is equal in its area to the rectangle that has as its height the quantity 
possessed of the commodity supplied, and as its base the intensity of the 
maximum want for the commodity. 
his condition may or may not be fulilled. If it is, exchanger (1)’s 
supply of (B) will be, in certain cases, equal to the quantity qb,1 of 


Solution of the problem of the exchange of several commodities 137

which he is the holder. Moreover, the supply can never be greater 
than this quantity. It is therefore essential to notice that, for all the 
values ppppppbb , ppppppcc , pd , that would make y1 more negative than −qb,1
in the demand or supply equation of (B), this equation should be 
replaced by the equation yyyyy qqqqqb,1. 
119.  However, this is not all. First, the same observation is applicable 
to the equations of demand and supply for (C), (D),   for values of

122.  In this way, the  m – 1 prices of the  m – 1 commodities in terms 
of the mth taken as the numeraire will be determined mathematically 
by the threefold condition: 1° that each exchanger obtains maxi-
mum satisfaction of his wants, the ratios of the rareté s being equal 
to the prices;  

ii 2°  that everyone must receive in proportion to what 
he gives or must give in proportion to what he receives there being 
for each commodity only one price in terms of the numeraire, the 
one for which total efective demand equals total efective supply; 3°  
that arbitrage will not take place, the equilibrium price of the one in 
terms of the other of two commodities being equal to the ratio of the 
equilibrium price of each of them in terms of any third commod-
ity, that is, to the inverse ratio of the equilibrium prices of any third 
commodity in terms of each of them. Let us see now how this same 
problem of the exchange of several commodities for one another, for 
which we just have found the theoretical solution, is also the prob-
lem that is solved empirically in the market by the mechanism of 
competition. 
123.  To begin with, by adopting a numeraire  in the market, we have 
in fact reduced the m(m – 1) prices of the m commodities the one in 
terms of the other to  m – 1 prices of  m – 1 of them in terms of the m 

th. 
he latter is the numeraire; and, as for the ( m – 1)(m – 1) prices of the 
other commodities in one another, these are assumed to be equal to 
the ratios of the prices of the commodities in numeraire in accordance 
with the condition of general equilibrium. Let pppppbb′′′, pppppcc′′′, pd′ , be m – 1 
prices of (B), (C), (D),   in terms of (A) cried in this way, at random. 
At these prices so cried, each exchanger determines his demand  or 
his supply of (A), (B), (C), (D),  . his takes place ater relection, 
without calculation, but exactly as if it were done by calculation in 
accordance with the system of equations of equivalence of the quan-
tities demanded and supplied and of maximum satisfaction under the 
agreed upon restrictions. Let xxxxx111, xxxxx222 , x3′,, yyyyy11′, yyyyy22′, y3′, , zzzzz111′′′,zzzzz222′′′,z3′,, 
wwwww111′,wwwww222′,w3′,, positive or negative, be the partial demands or sup-
plies corresponding to the prices pppppbb′′′, pppppcc′′′, pd′ ,. If the total demand 


140 heory of exchange

and supply relating to each commodity were equal; that is to say, if we 
immediately had Y′ = 0,  Z′ = 0,  W ′ = 0,   and, consequently,  X′ = 0, 
exchange would take place at these prices, and the problem would 
be solved. However, generally total demand and total supply for each 
commodity will be unequal, that is to say, Y′ 0, Z′ 0,W′ 0,,
and, consequently, X′ 0. What will people do in the market in this 
case? If demand is greater than supply, they will increase the price of 
the commodity in numeraire; if supply is greater than demand, they 
will lower the price. What must therefore be proved to establish that 
the theoretical solution and the one in the market are identical? he 
answer is simply that raising and lowering prices  is a method of solv-
ing by tatonnement the system of equations  of equality of demand 
and supply. 
124.  Let us recall that we have the equation

the function ∆b representing the sum of the positive ys, hence Db , and 
the function ΩΩΩb the sum of the negative ys taken as positive, hence Ob. 
Let us abstract from pppppcc′′′, pppppdd′′′ ,, supposing these prices as predeter-
mined, and let us ind out how the price pb has to be varied between 
0 and ininity so that the demand for (B) becomes equal to its supply. 
We do not know the function Fb , nor the functions ∆b and ΩΩΩb, but 
from the very nature of the fact of exchange, as we have studied it, we 
can deduce with respect to these functions suicient information to 
be sure that, in the operation under consideration, pb will meet with 
a value, if it exists, that will make F b  pass through zero, or will bring 
about equality of ∆b and ΩΩΩb. 
126.  With regard to, irst, the function ∆b of the demand for (B) in 
exchange for (A), (B), (D), , we can say that it is positive for pb = 0; 
that is to say, for prices of (B) that are zero in terms of (A), (C), (D), 
. Indeed, at these prices, the total efective demand for (B) equals 
the excess of total extensive utility over the total quantity possessed, 
and this excess will be positive if commodity (B) is scarce and is part 
of social wealth. If pb increases and, with it, all the prices of (B) in 
terms of (A), (C), (D),   in proportion, the function will decrease, 
since it is a sum of decreasing functions. hen, indeed, the commod-
ity (B) will become more and more expensive compared with the 
commodities (A), (C), (D), ; now, it cannot happen, under this 
hypothesis, and, moreover, all other things being unchanged, that its 
demand increases: it can only decrease. What is more, we can, in any 
event, assume that there is a value of pb, that is to say, prices of (B) in 
terms of (A), (C), (D),  , so high, possibly ininite, that the demand 
for (B) is zero. 
With regard to the function ΩΩΩb of the supply of (B) for (A), (C), 
(D), , we can say that it is zero for pb = 0, and possibly even for 
certain positive values of pb; that is to say, for zero or even positive 
prices of (B) in terms of (A), (C), (D), . Indeed, just as we can 
assume that there are prices of (B) in terms of (A), (C), (D),   so 
high that its demand is zero, we can also assume that there are prices 
of (A), (C), (D),   in terms of (B) so high that their demand is zero, 


142 heory of exchange
in which case the supply of (B) is zero. If pb increases, and, with it all 
prices of (B) in terms of (A), (C), (D),  proportionally, the function 
ΩΩΩb will be successively increasing and decreasing because it is a sum 
of functions that are successively increasing and decreasing. hen, 
indeed, the commodities (A), (C), (D),   will become less and less 
expensive compared with the commodity (B), and the demand for 
these commodities will materialize at the same time as the supply of 
(B) that accompanies them. However, the supply does not increase 
indeinitely; it will pass through at least one maximum, which can-
not be superior to the total quantity possessed, and become zero 
again if pb tends to ininity; that is to say, if (A), (C), (D),   are free 
commodities. 
127. Under these conditions, and provided that Db does not become 
zero before Ob ceases to be so, in which case there is no solution, there 
exists a certain value of pb for which Ob and Db are equal. In order to 
ind this value, we must increase pb′ if, at the price pb′, we have  Y ′ > 0, 
hence DDDb′′′ >>>>>> OOOb′, and decrease pb′ if, at the price pb′, we have Y′ < 0, 
hence OOOb′′′ >>>>>> DDDb′. In this way, we get the equation 
 FFFbbbbbbbb (((ppppbbbbbbbb′′,,, ppppcccccccc′,, pppdd′ ,,))))) ..... 
Having carried out this operation, the function  
 FFFccccccc (((ppppppbbbbbbb′,,, ppppppccccccccc′, ppddddddddd′ ,) 0 
has become  
 FFccccccc (((pppppbbbbbbb′′,,, pppppccccccccc′, pppddddddddd′ ,))))) ;;;;; 
but we can obtain the equation  
 FFFccccccc (((pppppbbbbbbb′′,,, pppppccccccccc′′, ppddddddddd′ ,) = 0 
by increasing or decreasing pc′ in accordance with whether we have, at 
the price pc′, either Z ′ > 0, hence DDDc′′′ >>>>>> OOOc′ , or Z′ < 0, hence OOOc′′′ >>>>>> DDDc′. 
Similarly, we get the equation  


Solution of the problem of the exchange of several commodities 143
FFFccccccc (((pppppbbbbbbb′′,,, pppppccccccccc′′, ppddddddddd′′,))))) ;;;;; iv
and so forth. 
128.  Having carried out all these operations, we have  
FFFbbbbbbbb (((ppppbbbbbbbb′′,,, ppppcccccccc′′,, ppdd′′,,))))) ,,,,,v 
and it must be demonstrated that this function is closer to zero than 
the original basic one  
FFFbbbbbbbb (((pppppbbbbbbbb′,,, pppppcccccccc′,, ppdd′ ,,))))) .....
Now, this will appear probable 

vi if it is recognized that the change of 
pb′ to pb′′ that has brought the latter inequality into equality has had 
efects that are direct and, at least as far as concerns the demand for 
(B), all in the same direction, whereas the change of pc′ into pc′′, of 
pd′ into pd′′, and so forth, which have changed the latter from equal-
ity into the inequality, have had indirect efects and, at least as far as 
concerns the demand for (B), in opposite directions, and has can-
celled out each other to a certain degree. For this reason, the system 
of new prices pppppbb′′′′′′, pppppcc′′, pd′′, is closer to equilibrium than the old sys-
tem of prices pppppbb′′′, pppppcc′′′, pd′ ,, and we have only to continue in the same 
way to approach equilibrium more and more closely.  
So, we have arrived at the following formulation of the law of the 
determination of the equilibrium prices  in the case of exchange of 
several commodities for one another by means of a numeraire: – 
Given several commodities, the exchange of which takes place by means 
of a numeraire, for the market to be in equilibrium, or for stationary 
prices of all these commodities, it is necessary and suicient that at 
these prices the efective demand for each commodity is equal to its 
efective supply. When this equality does not exist, it is necessary, in 
order to bring about equilibrium, to increase the price of the commod-
ities for which the efective demand is greater than the efective supply, 
and decrease the price of the commodities for which the efective supply 
is greater than the efective demand. 


144 heory of exchange

Notes
i To make a correct assertion, Walras should have inserted at this place: ‘and 
when no other commodities are supplied, i.e., when all the other commod-
ities are demanded’.
ii Walras meant ‘the ratios of the raretés being equal to the ratios of the 
prices’.
iii Strictly speaking, Walras should have written ‘at least one of the rest should 
be negative’.
iv he other prices in this function have only one prime.
v Now all the prices in the functions have a double prime.
vi Regarding the stability, Walras wrote ‘certain’ in the irst edition of the 
Éléments.

LESSON 13

Law of the variation of the prices of the 
commodities

SUMMARy: – Analytical deinition of the exchange of several 
commodities for one another. Identity of the ratio of the rareté of 
any two commodities for all the exchangers in the state of general 
equilibrium. Proportionality of the exchange values to the raretés. 
Reservation regarding the case of discontinuity of the want curves. 
Reservation regarding the case of zero demand, or of supply 
equal to the quantity possessed. Average raretés. Undetermined 
and arbitrary terms of value in exchange. Variation in the prices 
because of variation in the utility and the quantity. Unchanging 
prices and simultaneous variation of utility and of quantity. on 
the law known as the law of supply and demand.
129. From the preceding considerations, it is quite obvious that, for 
several commodities as for two, the necessary and suicient elements 
for the determination of the current prices, or equilibrium prices, 
are the exchangers’ equations of utility or want of the commodities, 
equations that can always be represented by curves, and the quan-
tities of the commodities possessed by their holders. From these 
constituent elements result mathematically: 1° the partial and total 
demand and supply equations, and 2° the current, or equilibrium, 
prices. To the conditions of maximum satisfaction, on the one hand, 
and unity of the prices of whatever two commodities, with equality 
of total supply and demand of the one in terms of the other, on the 
other hand, we have only to add here the condition of general equi-
librium of the prices.
Hence: – Exchange of several commodities for one another in a 
market governed by free competition is an operation by means of 


146 heory of exchange

which all the holders, either of one, or of several, or of all of these com-
modities, can obtain the greatest satisfaction of their needs compat-
ible with the condition that not only are two arbitrary commodities 
exchanged in a common, identical proportion, but that, moreover, 
these two commodities can be exchanged for an arbitrary third one 
in accordance with two proportions, the ratio of which is equal to the 
irst one.
130. If prices have been cried in terms of the numeraire, the condi-
tion of general economic equilibrium has been fulilled ipso facto. 
otherwise, it would have been brought about by arbitrage. It is useful 
to be aware of the exact result of these operations.
Let trader (1) be a holder of (A), trader (2) a holder of (B), trader (3) a 
holder of (C); let ra,1,rb,1,rc,1,rd,1,,ra,2 ,rb,2 ,rc,2 ,rd,2 ,,ra,3 ,rb,3 ,rc,3 ,rd,3 , 
be the raretés of the commodities (A), (B), (C), (D),  for these three 
traders, and, for the time being, let these raretés be variable, depend-
ing on the variable prices. Under the hypothesis that arbitrage does 
not occur, the condition of maximum satisfaction can be expressed

If it is noted that the reasoning concerning the three commodities 
(A), (B) and (C), and the traders (1), (2) and (3) can be extended 
to all commodities and all traders, it can be seen that: – When the 
market is in a state of general equilibrium, the ratio of the raretés of 
two arbitrary commodities, equal to the price of the one in terms of the 
other, is the same for all the holders of these two commodities.

In setting forth and solving the equations of exchange, we have 
until now considered only the case of commodities that can be con-
sumed in ininitely small quantities, and that have utility curves or 
want curves that are continuous. But we have also to give attention to 
the cases of commodities that are by their nature consumed in inte-
gral units, having utility or want curves that are discontinuous. hese 
cases are numerous. Cases in point are those of furniture, articles 
of clothing, etc. here is always a substantial diference of intensity 
between the irst bed, a irst piece of clothing, a irst hat, a irst pair of 
shoes, and that of a second article of the same type, and also between 
the utility of a second object and that of a third one, etc. his dife-
rence is sometimes even substantial. hus, a irst pair of crutches for 
a lame person, a irst pair of glasses for a short-sighted person, a irst 
violin for a professional musician, are, so to speak, indispensible; a 
second pair of crutches or glasses, or a second violin are, in a way, 
superluous. In all these cases it would be necessary, for several com-
modities as for two, to put into the tables of rareté, underlining them, 
proportional terms that would be very close to the average of the last 
wants satisied and the irst wants unsatisied.
Moreover, here too it is possible that one or several terms are lack-
ing among the raretés of a given trader. his happens every time that 
a trader, not being a holder of a certain commodity, will not be a 


Law of the variation of the prices of the commodities 149

demander of it at the current price, or, being a holder, will be a supplier 
of all of it that he possesses. he rich persons are those whose last wants 
satisied are numerous and of little intensity, and the poor persons, on 
the contrary, are those whose last wants satisied are few and intense. 
And here also, for the case of several commodities as for the case of 
two, we will have to put into the above tables, putting them within 
parentheses, the terms that would be obtained by taking the price of 
the commodity not consumed in terms of any other commodity that is 
consumed and multiplying that price by the rareté of the latter.
Under this double reservation, we can state the following 
proposition:
– he values in exchange are proportional to the raretés.
132. Let, on the one hand, (A), (B) and (D) be commodities that can 
be consumed in ininitely small quantities; and let, consequently, 
αr,1αq,1, αr,2αq,2, αr,3αq,3 , βr,1βq,1 , βr,2βq,2 , βr,3βq,3, δr,1δq,1 , δr,2δq,2 , 
δr,3δq,3 (Fig. 17) be the continuous utility or want curves of the these 
commodities for the traders (1), (2), (3). Let, on the other hand, 
(C) be a commodity that is, because of its nature, consumed in unit 
quantities, and let, consequently, γ r,1γ q,1, γ r,2 γ q,2 , γ r,3γ q,3 , be the 
discontinuous utility or want curves of this commodity for the trad-
ers (1), (2), (3), . Let the prices of (B), (C), and (D) in terms of (A) 
be 2, 2.5 and 0.5.
In the example of our igure, trader (1) is a rich man who con-
sumes (A), (B), (C), and (D) in quantities 7, 8, 7, and 6, and who 
obtains the small raretés 2, 4, 6 and 1, procuring a very considerable 
total amount of efective utility represented by [the sum of] the sur-
faces oqa,1ra,1αr,1,oqb,1rb,1βr,1, oqc,1rc,1γ r,1, oqd,1rd,1δr,1 . he raretés of 
(A), (B), and (D), namely 2, 4 and 1, are strictly proportional to the 
prices 1, 2 and 0.5. he rareté of (C), 6, should be replaced by the 
underlined number 5 = 2 × 2.5, intermediate between the intensity 6 
of the last want satisied and the intensity 4 of the irst want not sat-
isied of (C). Trader (2) is a poor man who consumes (A) and (D) in 
quantities 3 and 2 and obtains the large raretés 6 and 3, procuring a 
insigniicant total amount of efective utility represented by the sur-
faces oqa,2ra,2αr,2 and oqd,2rd,2δr,2; he abstains from consuming (C) 
or (D) because the amounts 12 = 6 × 2 and 15 = 6 × 2.5, that should

11 of the irst wants to be satisied of these commodities. And, trader 
(3) is simply a wealthy man who consumes (A), (B) and (D) in quan-
tities 5, 4 and 3 and obtains the moderate raretés 4, 8 and 2, procuring 
an unexceptional total amount of efective utility represented by the 
surfaces oqa,3ra,3αr,3 ,oqb,3rb,3βr,3 ,oqd,3rd,3δr,3, but who does without 
(C) because the amount 10 = 4 × 2.5, that should have been put into 
the series of raretés, exceeds 8, the intensity of the irst want for this 
commodity to be satisied. Putting these proportional amounts cor-
responding to virtual, non-efective raretés between parenthesis, we 
obtain the equilibrium table:

133. he ratios of the average raretés will be, as we know, the same as 
that of the individual raretés. In determining the averages, we must 
take account only of the underlined proportional numbers and the 
ones between parentheses. Under these conditions, and denoting the 
average raretés of (A), (B), (C), (D),  by Ra ,Rb ,Rc ,Rd ,, we can

134. he fact of value in exchange, which is such a complicated fact, 
in particular in the case of several commodities, inally appears here 
in its true character. What are νa , νb , νc , νd ,? Absolutely nothing 
other than undetermined and arbitrary terms regarding which only 
the ratio represent the common and identical ratio of all the com-
modities for all the traders in the state of general equilibrium in the

market; of the raretés and, consequently, regarding which only their 
ratios two by two, equal to the ratios two by two of the raretés of any 
trader, can be given a numerical expression. So, value in exchange 
remains an essentially relative fact, always having its cause in rareté, 
which alone is an absolute fact. As before, however, just as there is 
no more for each trader than m raretés of the m commodities, there 
is, in a market in the state of general equilibrium, no more than m 
undetermined terms of value in exchange of these commodities, of 
which the combination two by two gives the m(m – 1) prices of these 
commodities in terms of one another. his circumstance permits, in 
certain cases, the arbitrary terms themselves to be brought into the 
calculations, instead of their ratios. one would even be tempted to go 
a little further and beneit from this circumstance by stating that in 
a state of general equilibrium, each commodity has only one exchange 
value with respect to all other commodities in the market. But this 
way of putting it would perhaps point too much into the direction of 
absolute value; it is better to express the fact being considered here by 
using the terms of the theorem of general equilibrium (§ 110) or the 
analytical deinition of exchange (§ 129).
135. he utilities and the quantities possessed being always the causes 
and the initial conditions of the determination of the prices, they are 
also by this very fact always the causes and the initial conditions for 
the variations of these prices.
Assume equilibrium is established and let the several traders be 
in possession of certain quantities of (A), (B), (C), (D),  that, at 
the prices pb , pc , pd , of (B), (C), (D),  in terms of (A), give them 
maximum satisfaction. Furthermore, let us reserve the expressions 
increase in utility and decrease in utility to denote shits of the want 
curve that have as a result an increase or decrease in the intensity 
of the last want satisied, or the rareté ater the exchange. And, this 
being well understood, let us assume there is an increase in the util-
ity of (B); that is to say, a shit of the want curve of (B) resulting 
in an increase in the rareté of (B) for certain traders. here is no 
longer maximum satisfaction for these individuals. on the contrary, 
at the prices pb , pc , pd ,, it is advantageous for them to demand (B) 
in exchange for (A), (C), (D), . Hence, where there existed equality 
of demand and supply for all the commodities (A), (B), (C), (D), ,  


Law of the variation of the prices of the commodities 153

there will be now, at these prices, an excess of the demand for (B) 
over its supply and an excess of the supply of (A), (C), (D),  over 
the demand for these goods, resulting in a rise of the price of (B). But 
then there will no longer be maximum satisfaction for the other trad-
ers. on the contrary, it will be advantageous for them, at a price of 
(B) in terms of (A) superior to pb, to ofer (B) and demand (A), (C), 
(D). he equilibrium will be re-established when demand and supply 
for all the commodities will be equal. So, the increase in the utility of 
(B) for our traders will have had for result an increase in the price of 
(B). It can also result in price changes for (C), (D), . However, irst, 
this second result will be less important than the irst if the goods 
other than (B) are numerous in the market, and if, consequently, the 
quantity of each of them exchanged for (B) is very small. Second, 
moreover, nothing indicates whether these changes of the prices of 
(C), (D), will be price increases or price decreases, nor even if they 
have taken place, as one can convince himself by studying the situ-
ation of the raretés when the new equilibrium is established ater the 
complementary exchange. In this operation, the ratios of the raretés 
of (B) to those of (A) will have necessarily increased for all traders: 
they will have increased by the increase in the raretés of (B) and the 
decrease in the raretés of (A) for those whose utility of (B) did not 
increase and who have sold (B) and bought (A), (C), (D), , and 
they will have increased by the increase in the raretés of (A) and the 
greater increase in the raretés of (B) for those traders for whom the 
utility of (B) has increased and who have bought (B) and sold (A), 
(C), (D), . As far as regards the ratios of the raretés of (C), (D),  
to the raretés of (A), some will have increased, others decreased, and 
others, inally, will have remained unchanged; consequently, among 
the prices of (C), (D),  some will have increased, others will have 
decreased, and others will have remained stationary. To sum up, it 
should be noticed that the raretés of (B) have increased for all traders 
in the sense that the average rareté has increased, whereas the raretés 
of (A), (C), (D),  have increased for some and decreased for others 
in such a way that the average rareté has scarcely changed. If one 
so wishes, the above phenomena for a trader of each category can 
be represented graphically. In Fig. 17, for instance, the utility of (B) 
having increased for trader (1), that trader has bought (B) and sold 
(A) and (D); trader (2)’s position did not change; and trader (3) has 


154 heory of exchange

sold (B) and bought (A) and (D). hese are the results of increase in 
the utility of (B); obviously, a decrease in this utility would have had 
the opposite results; that is to say, a fall of the price of (B) and hardly 
appreciable changes of the prices of (C), (D), .
We only have to look to the want curves to see that an increase in 
the quantity possessed will result in a decrease in the rareté, and that 
a decrease of the quantity possessed will result in an increase in the 
rareté. Moreover, as we have seen above, when the rareté decreases or 
increases, the price will decrease or increase. hus, the efects of the 
variation in the quantity possessed are purely and simply the oppos-
ite of those of the variation in the utility, and we can state the law that 
we seek as follows:
– Given several commodities in a state of general equilibrium in a 
market with a numeraire as intermediary, if, everything else remaining 
the same, the utility of one of these commodities increases or decreases 
for one or more traders, then the price of this commodity in numeraire 
increases or decreases.
If, everything else remaining the same, the quantity of one of these 
commodities increases or decreases for one or more traders, then the 
price of this commodity increases or decreases.
We observe that whereas the variation in the prices indicates 
necessarily a variation in the elements of these prices, the persistence 
of these prices does not necessarily imply the persistence of the elem-
ents of the prices. Indeed, we can, without further demonstration, 
state the following twofold proposition:
– Several commodities being given, if the utility and the quantity 
of one of these commodities for one or more of the traders or holders 
vary such that the raretés do not change, the price of this commodity 
remains unchanged.
If the utility and the quantity of all the commodities for one or more 
traders or holders vary such that the ratios of the raretés do not change, 
the prices will remain unchanged.
136. his is the law of the variation of the equilibrium prices; uniting it 
with the law of the determination of the equilibrium prices (§ 128), we 
obtain the scientiic formulation of what is called in economics THE 
LAW oF SUPPLy AND DEMAND, a fundamental law, but one that until now 
has been formulated only in meaningless or erroneous expressions. 


Law of the variation of the prices of the commodities 155

hus, it is sometimes said: ‘he price of things is determined by the 
ratio of supply to demand’, aiming in particular at the determination 
of the prices; and sometimes: ‘he price of things varies directly with 
demand and indirectly with supply’, thus aiming rather at the vari-
ation of prices. However, in the irst place, in order to give these two 
expressions, which really state the same thing, any meaning, it would 
be necessary to deine supply and demand. And then, whether sup-
ply be deined by efective supply or by the quantity possessed or 
existing, and demand deined by efective demand, or by utility, be it 
extensive, intensive, or virtual, if one means the word proportion in 
the mathematical sense of a quotient, it is certain that the price is no 
more the ratio of demand to supply than it is the ratio of supply to 
demand, and does no more vary directly with demand and inversely 
with supply than it varies directly with supply and inversely with 
demand. I therefore take the liberty of remarking that, until now, 
the fundamental law of economics has not only never been demon-
strated, but has never even been formulated correctly. And I permit 
myself to add that, to provide the formulation and the demonstration 
of the law in question, or of the two laws of which it is composed, it 
was necessary to deine efective supply and efective demand, and 
to study the relation of efective supply and efective demand with 
the price, to deine rareté, and also to study the relation of rareté to 
the price, all being things that it is impossible to do without having 
recourse to the language, the method, and the principles of math-
ematics. From this it follows, to sum it all up, that the mathematical 
form is, for economic theory, not only a possible form, but the neces-
sary and indispensable form. I think, moreover, that this is a point 
with respect to which none of the readers who have followed me up 
to this point could have retained the least doubt.

LESSON 14

heorem of equivalent redistributions. 
Choice of a standard of measurement and of 
a medium of exchange

SUMMARy: – Redistribution of commodities among traders. 
Condition of equivalence of quantities possessed. Condition of 
equality of total quantities existing. Partial demand and supply 
in accordance with the condition of maximum satisfaction. he 
quantities demanded and the quantities supplied by each exchan-
ger are always equivalent. Total demand and total supply for each 
commodity are always equal. Hence, the current prices do not 
change under the two conditions of the equivalence of the quan-
tities possessed and the equality of the total quantities. Necessity 
of the two conditions.
Numeraire, Standard, Change of standard. Rational statement 
of the price; popularized statement. Twofold error of the popu-
lar statement: 1° the value of the standard is not ixed and invari-
able; 2° there is nothing that can be the value of the standard. he 
standard is not the value of a certain quantity of the numeraire, 
but is this quantity itself. Measurement of value and of wealth by 
means of the numeraire. Money. Exchange of wealth by means of 
money.
137. he commodities (A), (B), (C), (D),  possessed respectively 
by the traders (1), (2), (3),  in quantities qa,1,qb,1,qc,1,qd,1,, 
qa,2 ,qb,2 ,qc,2 ,qd,2 ,¸ qa,3 ,qb,3 ,qc,3 ,qd,3 , are respectively the total 
quantities


heorem of equivalent redistributions 157
Qa = qa,1 + qa,2 + qa,3 +
Qb = qb,1 + qb,2 + qb,3 +
Qc = qc,1 + qc,2 + qc,3 +
Qd = qd ,1 + qd ,2 + qd ,3 +


And, under these conditions of quantity possessed together with the 
conditions of virtual utility determined by the utility or want equa-
tions, these commodities are exchanged for one another at the gen-
eral equilibrium prices pb , pc , pd ,.
Let us now assume that these same commodities (A), (B), (C), (D), 
 are redistributed among the traders (1), (2), (3),  in a diferent 
way but in such a way, however, that for each trader the amounts 
of the new quantities, qa′,1,qb′,1,qc′,1,qd′,1,, qa′,2 ,qb′,2 ,qc′,2 ,qd′,2 ,, 
qa′,3 ,qb′,3 ,qc′,3 ,qd′,3 , are equivalent to the original quantities; that is 
to say, in such a way that
qa,1 + qb,1 pb + qc,1 pc + qd,1 pd += qa′,1 + qb′,1 pb + qc′,1 pc + qd′,1 pd +
qa,2 + qb,2 pb + qc,2 pc + qd,2 pd += qa′,2 + qb′,2 pb + qc′,2 pc + qd′,2 pd +[1]
qa,3 + qb,3pb + qc ,3pc + qd ,3pd += qa′,3 + qb′,3pb + qc′,3pc + qd′,3pd +


Assume, moreover, that the total quantities in existence do not 
vary, or that the commodities (A), (B), (C), (D),  are the total 
quantities
Qa = qa′,1 + qa′,2 + qa′,3 +
Qb = qb′,1 + qb′,2 + qb′,3 +
Qc = qc′,1 + qc′,2 + qc′,3 + [2]
Qd = qd′,1 + qd′,2 + qd′,3 +




158 heory of exchange

I say that under these new conditions of quantity possessed, together 
with the old conditions of virtual utility, the prices pb , pc , pd , still 
are, theoretically and practically, the equilibrium prices.
138. Let us select trader (1) out of all of them and assume that at these 
prices he acquires the quantities, respectively, x1′ , y1′ , z1′ , w1′ , 
of the commodities (A), (B), (C), (D),  so that he has in all the 
quantities
qa′,1 + x1′ = qa,1 + x1
qc′,1 + y1′ = qb,1 + y1
qc′,1 + z1′ = qc,1 + z1 [3]
qd′,1 + w1′ = qd,1 + w1


In this way, this trader will obtain maximum satisfaction of his wants 
because the following system of equations is obviously satisied:
ϕb,1(qb′,1 + y1′) = pbϕa,1(qa′,1 + x1′ )
ϕc,1(qc′,1 + z′) = pcϕa,1(qa′,1 + x1′ )
ϕd,1 (qd′,1 + w1′) = pd ϕa,1(qa′,1 + x1′)



he traders (2), (3),  would also obtain maximum satisfaction 
of their wants if they would have acquired, at the prices indicated 
above, quantities x2′ , y2′ ,z2′ , w2′ ,, x3′ , y3′ , z3′ , w3′ , such that in 
all they would have the quantities
qa′,2 + x2′ = qa,2 + x2
qb′,2 + y2′ = qb,2 + y2


heorem of equivalent redistributions 159
qc′,2 + z2′ = qc,2 + z2 [3]
qd′,2 + w2′ = qd,2 + w2

and so forth.
It remains only to demonstrate that 1°, under the assumed condi-
tions, these traders can demand and supply the above quantities, and 
that 2°, under the same conditions, the total efective demand of each 
commodity is equal to its total efective supply.
139. Now, irst we have, because of system [1],
qa,1 − qa′,1 + (qb,1 − qb′,1 ) pb + (qc,1 − qc′,1 ) pc + (qd,1 − qd′,1)pd += 0;
this equation can, by virtue of system [3], be put into the form
x1′ − x1 + (y1′ − y1 ) pb + (z1′ − z1 ) pc + (w1′ − w1 ) pd += 0.
And, since we have
x1 + y1 pb + z1 pc + w1 pd += 0,
we have also
x1′ + y1′pb + z1′pc + w1′pd += 0.
Further we have, for the same reason,


160 heory of exchange
x2′ + y2′ pb + z2′pc + w2′ pd += 0,
x3′ + y3′pb + z3′pc + w3′pd += 0,

Consequently, the sum of the quantities of the commodities (A), (B), 
(C), (D),  demanded by the traders (1), (2), (3),  is equivalent, 
under the conditions deined above, to the sum of the quantities of 
these commodities supplied by these traders.

the system [3],

we have therefore also

Similarly, we have likewise
Y ′ = y1′ + y2′ + y3′ + = 0,

and, consequently, total efective demand and total efective supply 
for each commodity are equal.
141. he prices pb , pc , pd , are thus the theoretical equilibrium 
prices, ater, just as before the change of the distribution. And, since 
the mechanism of competition in the market is nothing other than 
the practical determination of the calculated prices, it follows that: – 
Given several commodities in a market in a state of general equilibrium, 
the current prices of these commodities do not change if the respective 
quantities are redistributed among the traders in any way whatsoever 
but provided that the sum of the quantities possessed by each of the 
traders remains always equivalent.
142. During the entire course of this demonstration, we have assumed 
that Qa ,Qb ,Qc ,Qd , do not change. Consequently, if the quantities 
of the commodities (A), (B), (C), (D),  in the possession of a trader, 
trader (1), for example, vary more or less within the limits imposed 
by the condition of equivalence, then it is evident that the quantity 
of these commodities in the possession of one or more other traders, 
traders (2) or (3), for example, would vary less or more within the 
same limits in order that the condition of ixedness of total quan-
tities be fulilled. It is certain that if these commodities exist in large 
quantities in the market, and if the traders themselves are present in 
large numbers, the variation between the limits of the condition of 
equivalence of the quantities in possession of a single trader with-
out the corresponding change of the quantities in possession of the 
other traders would not have any perceptible inluence on the prices 
and could be considered as not changing anything in the particular 
situation of our trader or in the general situation of the market. Here 
we have an application of the law of great numbers of which we can 
make good use in some cases. But here we want to remain within 
the domain of mathematical rigor; and to be able to assert that the 
prices do not change at all, we must assume that the two conditions, 
equivalence of the quantities possessed and constancy of the total 
quantities, are fulilled.
143. he theorem of the general equilibrium of the market can be 
stated in the following terms:


162 heory of exchange

– In the state of general equilibrium of the market the m(m – 1) 
prices that regulate the exchange of m commodities taken two at a time 
are implicitly determined by the m – 1 prices that regulate the exchange 
with the mth commodity of any of the m – 1 commodities chosen from 
the m commodities.
So, in the state of general equilibrium, we can deine the situation 
in the market completely by relating the values of all the commod-
ities to the value of one of them. his latter commodity is called the 
numeraire, and a unit of it is called the standard. Assuming the values 
of (A), (B), (C), (D),  thus related to the value of (A), we have the 
series of prices:
pa,a = 1, pb,a = µ, pc,a = π, pd,a = ρ,.
If, instead of relating the values to (A)’s, we had related them to the 
value of (B), we would have had the series of prices
pa,b = 1 , pb,b = , pc,b = , pd,b = , .

Hence: – In order to pass from one numeraire to another, it suices 
to divide the prices expressed in terms of the irst of these two numerai-
res by the price of the new standard expressed in the old numeraire.
144. In this system, let (A) be silver, and let a half-decagram of 9/10 
ine silver be its unit; let (B) be wheat, and let the hectoliter be its unit 
of quantity. he fact that, in the market in the state of general equi-
librium, a hectoliter of wheat will be exchanged currently for 24 half-
decagrams of silver of 9/10 ine will be expressed by the equation
pb,a = 24,
which should be stated thusly: – ‘he price of wheat in silver is 24,’ 
or, if we wish to mention the quantity units: – ‘he price of a hecto-
liter of wheat is 24 half-decagrams of silver 9/10 ine,’ or, diferently: 
‘A hectoliter of wheat is worth 24 half-decagrams of silver 9/10 ine.’ 
Between this statement and the one that we have used in our gen-
eral considerations (§ 29) about practical usage and that is conceived 


heorem of equivalent redistributions 163

thusly – ‘Wheat is worth 24 francs per hectoliter’, there is a diference 
consisting in the substitution of the word francs for the words half-
decagrams of silver 9/10 ine. his diference needs to be discussed 
meticulously.
he word franc, is, in the thought of many people, analogous to 
the words, meter, gram, liter, etc. Now, the word meter expresses two 
things: irst, it expresses the length of a certain fraction of the terres-
trial meridian, and, second, it expresses a ixed and invariable unit 
of length. Likewise, the word gram expresses two things: irst, the 
weight of a certain quantity of distilled water at its maximum dens-
ity, and, second, a ixed and invariable unit of weight. Likewise for 
the liter in regard to capacity. he same applies also, in the eyes of 
ordinary persons, to the word franc. his word expresses two things: 
irst, the value of a certain quantity of silver, and second, a ixed and 
invariable unit of value.
Two points have to be distinguished regarding those opinions on 
the matter: 1° that the word franc expresses the value of the half-
decagram of silver 9/10 ine; 2° that this value, taken as the unit, is 
ixed and invariable. he second point represents nothing more than 
a gross error that is not shared by any economist. Each person, how-
ever little he has occupied himself with economics, admits that there 
is the essential diference between the meter and the franc that the 
meter is a ixed and invariable unit of length, whereas the franc is a 
unit of value that is neither ixed nor invariable, but that, on the con-
trary, changes and varies from one place to another, from one time to 
another, because of circumstances that are more or less agreed upon. 
It is therefore not worth the trouble of losing any time refuting the 
point in question.
However, this second point set aside, there remains the irst one, 
namely that the franc is the value of a half-decagram of silver 9/10 
ine, like the meter is the length of the ten-millionth part of the quar-
ter of the terrestrial meridian. he franc, say the economists who sub-
scribe to this point of view, is a variable measure, but it is a measure. 
If all lengths, without exception, were in a continuous movement of 
change, because of contraction or dilation of matter, we could meas-
ure them only within certain limits, but we could still measure them 
within these limits. Well, as we know, all values vary in a continuous 
movement of change: that forbids us to compare them between one 


164 heory of exchange

point and another, between one time and another, but not to com-
pare them or to measure at a given point, or at a given time. We will 
measure them under those conditions.
In this system, (A) being silver, the half-decagram 9/10 ine of sil-
ver being the unit of silver, and (B) being wheat, the hectoliter being 
the unit quantity of wheat, it is thought to be possible to posit the 
equation
va = 1franc,
and then the fact that, in the market, 1 hectoliter of wheat is currently 
exchanged for 24 half-decagrams of silver 9/10 ine can be expressed 
by the equation
vb = 24 francs,
which can be expressed as follows: ‘Wheat is worth 24 francs per 
hectoliter.’
However, this second point is an error, just as is the irst one; and, 
in neither this respect nor in the other is there any analogy between 
value on the one hand, and length, weight, capacity on the other. 
When I measure a given length, the length of a façade, for instance, 
there are three things: the length of the façade, the length of the ten-
millionth part of a quarter of the terrestrial meridian, and the ratio of 
the irst length to the second one, which is the façade’s measurement. 
In order that there be an analogy and that I can, at a given point, at 
a given time, measure similarly a given value, the value of a hecto-
liter of wheat, for instance, there must be three things: the value of 
the hectoliter of wheat, the value of the half-decagram of silver 9/10 
ine, and the ratio of the irst value to the second one, which is the 
measurement of the value of the hectoliter of wheat. Now, two of 
these three things do not exist, the irst and the second; only the third 
exists. our analysis has perfectly well demonstrated that value is an 
essentially relative thing. Undoubtedly, behind relative value there is 
something absolute, namely the intensities of the last wants satisied, 
or the raretés. But these raretés, which are absolute and not relative, 
are subjective or personal and not at all part of external reality or 
objective. hey are within us, and not within the things. It is there-
fore impossible to substitute them for the values in exchange. From 


heorem of equivalent redistributions 165

this follows that there is nothing that is either the rareté or the value 
of a half-decagram of silver 9/10 ine, and the word franc is a word for 
a thing that does not exist. J.-B. Say clearly perceived this truth, one 
which our science must always keep in mind.
145. It does not follow from this that we are unable to measure value 
and wealth; it follows only that our standard of measure must be a 
certain quantity of a certain commodity, and not the value of that 
quantity of the commodity.
As always, let (A) be the numeraire, and let the unit quantity of 
(A) be the standard of measure. Regarding the values, they measure 
themselves, because their ratios appear directly as the inverse ratios 
of the quantities of commodities exchanged. In this way, the ratios of 
the values of (B), (C), (D),  to the value of (A) appear directly in 
numbers of units of (A) exchanged for 1 of (B), 1 of (C), 1 of (D), ; 
that is to say, in the prices of (B), (C), (D),  in terms of (A).
Under these circumstances, let Qa,1 be the quantity of (A) equiva-
lent to the total amount of the quantities (A), (B), (C), (D),  in pos-
session of trader (1), so that we have, designating the prices of (B), 
(C), (D),  in terms of (A) simply by pb , pc , pd ,,
Qa,1 = qa,1 + qb,1 pb + qc,1 pc + qd,1 pd +.
By virtue of the theorem of equivalent redistributions, we can vary 
qa,1,qb,1,qc,1,qd,1,. Provided that the new quantities satisfy the equa-
tion above (together with the condition of the equality of the total 
quantities of the commodities), they permit trader (1) always to obtain 
in the market, at the prices pb , pc , pd ,, quantities of (A), (B), (C), 
(D),  that yield him, at these prices, maximum satisfaction. Qa,1,  
representing all these diferent quantities, and also the quantities of 
maximum satisfaction, is therefore the quantity of wealth possessed 
by trader (1).
Let, under the same conditions,
Qa,2 = qa,2 + qb,2 pb + qc,2 pc + qd,2 pd +
Qa,3 = qa,3 + qb,3 pb + qc,3 pc + qd,3 pd +




166 heory of exchange
Qa,2 ,Qa,3 , will be the quantities of wealth possessed by traders 
(2), (3), . hese quantities are comparable to Qa,1 and are compar-
able to one another, being composed of units of the same kind of 
commodity.
Let, inally, Qa ,Qb ,Qc ,Qd , be the total quantities of (A), (B), (C), 
(D),  existing in the market, and let
Qa = Qa,1 + Qa,2 + Qa,3 +
= Qa + Qb pb + Qc pc + Qd pd +.
Qa will be the total existing quantity of wealth in the mar-
ket; and this quantity is comparable to Qa,1,Qa,2 ,Qa,3 , and to 
Qa ,Qb pb ,Qc pc ,Qd pd ,.
146. hat is the true role of the instrument of measurement of value 
and wealth. But, generally, the same commodity that serves as numer-
aire serves also as money and plays the role of medium of exchange. 
he numeraire standard thus becomes a money standard. hese are 
the two functions that, even when both being operative, are distinct; 
ater having explained the irst function, we must also explain the 
second.
Let (A) still be the commodity designated to serve as medium of 
exchange. Let, as before, pb = µ, pc = π, pd = ρ, . At these prices of gen-
eral equilibrium correspond, by virtue of the condition of maximum 
satisfaction, the quantities efectively demanded that are equal to the 
quantities efectively supplied: M, P, R, , N, F, H, , Q, G, K, ,  
S, J, L,  of the commodities (A), (B), (C), (D), . And, under 
the hypothesis of direct exchange, this exchange will take place in 
accordance with the equations
Nvb = Mva , Qvc = Pva , Svd = Rva ,,
Gvc = Fvb , Jvd = Hvb , Lvd = Kvc ,.
147. But, given the hypothesis of the intervention of money, which 
is unquestionably the hypothesis that conforms to reality, things are 
diferent. Let (A) be silver, (B) wheat, (C) cofee, etc. In reality, the 


heorem of equivalent redistributions 167

producer of wheat sells his wheat for silver, and the producer of cof-
fee acts likewise; with the silver thus received, the one buys cofee 
and the other buys wheat. hat is what we assume here. he holders 
of (A) will become intermediaries because of the fact that they hold 
the money commodity. he holders of (B) will sell to them, at the 
price µ, all the wheat they want to sell, only under the condition of 
buying from them, at prices π, ρ, , all the (C), (D),  they want to 
buy. hese transactions can be expressed by the equations
(N + F + H +)vb = (M + Fµ + Hµ +)va
(Fµ = Gπ)va = Gvc , (Hµ = Jρ)va = Jvd .
he holders of (C), (D),  will carry out analogous transactions, 
which can be expressed by the equations
(Q + G + K +)vc = (P + Gπ + Kπ +)va .
(Gπ = Fµ)va = Fvb , (κπ = Lρ)va = Lvd 
(S + J + L +)vd = (R + Jρ + Lρ +)va
(Jρ = Hµ)vb = Hvb , (Lρ = Kπ)va = Kvc .
148. We are assuming here that the purchases and resales of (A) as 
intermediary take place in such a way that the price of that commod-
ity will not be inluenced at all. In reality, the use of a commodity as 
money does have a certain inluence that we will study later on. But, 
subject to this qualiication, we see that there exists a perfect analogy 
between the intervention of money and the intervention of a numer-
aire. Likewise, just as from the two equations
v

we derive

,

similarly, from the two equations
(Fµ = Gπ)va = Gvc , (Gπ = Fµ)va = Fvb ,
we derive
Gvc = Fvb .
hus, just as we pass, when we so desire, from the indirect price to the 
direct price by making abstraction from the numeraire, we can also 
pass, when we so desire, from indirect exchange to direct exchange 
by making abstraction from money.

149. he adoption of a commodity as numeraire and money has as 
a result the simpliication of the determination of the current gen-
eral equilibrium prices by reducing the case of the exchange of sev-
eral commodities for one another to the case of the exchange of two 
commodities for each other. hat is the simpliication that we have 
to study now, which is all the more necessary because in adopting 
the hypothesis of the use of a numeraire and of money, we approach 
more and more closely the reality of things.
Let (A) therefore be the numeraire and money. Let now, on the 
one hand, P′, R′, , Q′, K′, , S′, L′,  be quantities of the commod-
ities (A), (C), (D),  efectively demanded and equal to the quan-
tities efectively supplied, and exchanged or lent for one another at 
the general equilibrium prices pc = π , pd = ρ,  of (C), (D),  in 
terms of (A), in accordance with the equations
(Q′ + K′ +)vc = (P′ + K′π +)va


170 heory of exchange
(K′ π = L′ρ)va = L′vd 
(S′ + L′ +)vd = (R′ + L′ρ +)va
(L′ρ = K′ π)va = K′vc 
And, on the other hand, let commodity (B) be available in the market 
for exchange for (A), (C), (D), .
Having posited this, let us consider a holder of (B), selected from 
all holders. If, at price pb of (B) in terms of (A), corresponding to 
a price 1
pb

 of (A) in terms of (B), this holder supplies a quantity ob 
of (B), he will receive in exchange a quantity da = ob pb of (A); and, 
knowing, moreover, the prices of (C), (D),  in terms of (A), he can 
decide with full knowledge of the facts how to distribute this quantity 
of (A) among (A), (C), (D), . In other words, knowing the deter-
mined prices π, ρ, , he is only ignorant of the undetermined price 
pb ; but he can make all possible hypotheses about this price, and, 
for each of these hypotheses, express his disposition to bid, either by 
means of a supply curve of (B) as a function of pb , or by a demand 
curve adap of (A) as a function of 1
pb

 (Fig. 18).
It is in this way that things take place in reality. A new commod-
ity being introduced into the market, the holders of that commodity 
determine their supply in accordance with its price, deciding on both 
what quantity of it they want to give up and what quantity of the 
other commodities they want to acquire.
on the other hand, let us consider a holder of (A), (C), (D), , 
selected from among all holders. If, at a price pb of (B) in terms 
of (A), this holder demands a quantity db of (B), he must give in 
exchange a quantity of (A), (C), (D),  equivalent to oa = db pb; and, 
knowing, moreover, the prices of (C), (D),  in terms of (A), he can 
decide, with full knowledge of the circumstances, how to distribute 
this quantity of (A) among (A), (C), (D), . In other words, know-
ing the determined prices π, ρ, , he is only ignorant of the undeter-
mined price pb; but he can make all possible hypotheses about this

price, and, for each of these hypotheses, express his disposition to bid 
by a demand curve bdbp as a function of pb (Fig. 19).
In this case also, things take place in just that way in reality. When 
a new commodity is introduced into the market, the holders of the 
other commodities determine their demand for that commodity in 
accordance with its price, deciding at the same time what quantity 
they want to acquire of it and what quantity they want to give up of 
the other commodities.
We have not spoken about the case in which a trader would be at 
the same time a holder of (B) and of (A), (C), (D), . But this case, 
too, is provided for in the theory of the exchange of two commodities 
for each other. Such a trader would have to produce two curves: a 
demand curve for (A) or a supply curve for (B) at certain prices, and 
a demand curve for (B) or a supply curve of (A) at reciprocal prices 
(§ 93). hese two curves would be added to the preceding ones.
he partial demand curves, being added, will give the total demand 
curves Ad Ap, BdBp (Fig. 20). From the demand curve Ad Ap for (A), 
the supply curve NP of (B) can be derived, which could, moreover, 
also be obtained directly by adding vertically the partial supply curves 
of this commodity. he curve BdBp, which is the demand curve for 
(B) in numeraire, can be called the purchase curve; and the curve NP, 
which is the supply curve of (B) ofered for numeraire, can be called 
the sales curve. he intersection of these two curves at point B will 
determine the price pb = µ.
150. But will this irst determination be deinitive? Here a question 
appears that did not exist regarding the exchange of two commod-
ities for each other. In the general equilibrium existing before the 
introduction of (B) in the market, we had, between the prices π, ρ,  
and the quantities to be exchanged at these prices P′, Q′, R′, S′, K′, L′, 
 the relations
P′ = Q′π, R′ = S′ρ, K′π = L′ρ,.
In order that this equilibrium will obtain ater the introduction of (B) 
we must have, between the prices µ, π, ρ,  and the quantities M, N, 
P, Q, R, S, F, G, H, J, K, L,  (§ 146), not only the relations


Purchase curves and sales curves 173

M = Nµ, Fµ = Gπ, Hµ = Jρ,
that we have in actuality, in accordance with the way in which µ has 
been determined, but we must also have the equations
P = Qπ, R = Sρ, Kπ = Lρ,.
Now, comparing these latter equations with the former, we readily 
obtain

for numeraire, in order that the general equilibrium will not be dis-
turbed and the determined price be deinitive, the reciprocal demands 
or supplies of the old commodities must be proportional, before and 
ater the introduction of the new commodity into the market.
his condition will almost never be completely fulilled, no more 
in the case of the appearance of a new commodity than in the case of a 
price increase of one of the old commodities. As a result, the demand 
for and the supply of (B) at the price π being equal, the demand for 
and the supply of (A), (C), (D),  at the prices π, ρ,  will have 
become unequal. We then ind ourselves in the general case, that is 
to say, we ind that we have to increase the price of the commodities 
the demand for which is superior to their supply, and to decrease 
the price of the commodities the supply of which is superior to their 
demand (§ 128). In this way, we arrive at a state of general equilib-
rium in which the price of (B) will be a little diferent from µ.
Not only will the condition in question hardly ever be completely 
fulilled; but one may even assume a case in which the commodity 
(B), able to play the role and take the place of some other commod-
ity (C) or (D), will cause a considerable fall in the price of the lat-
ter. his can be seen every day. However, if we put aside this special 
case and assume the commodity (B) is a commodity in a class of its 
own, or if we consider, among the commodities that were previously 
on the market, only those with which commodity (B) is not in any 
appreciable degree of competition, we readily recognize that, if the 
commodities are numerous and present in considerable quantities, 
the price µ resulting from the purchase curve and the sales curve of 
(B), determined as has been described above, will be approximately 
a deinitive price. Indeed, in this case, the portions of (A), (C), (D), 
 set aside to constitute the supply of these commodities for (B) will 
be very small fractions of each of these numerous commodities, and 
even smaller in a relative sense, that is, when considered relative to 
the quantity of each of them; therefore, those portions cannot per-
ceptibly change the original proportions of their exchange with all 
the other commodities.
151. here is a special case of the problem that occupies us that is 
extremely simple and that deserves special consideration: that is the 
case in which all the holders of the new commodity that appears on 


Purchase curves and sales curves 175

the market, be they holders of only this commodity (B), or of the old 
commodities also, ofer the entire quantity of the new commodity 
at any price, namely the total quantity in existence. he particular 
form of bidding in this case is that of a sale by auction, provided it is 
assumed that the total amount of the commodity is ofered at once. 
Mathematically, the current price is then determined by the intersec-
tion (Fig. 21) at πb of the purchase curve BdBp with the straight line 
parallel to the price axis through the point Qb such that the distance 
oQb is equal to the existing quantity of (B). his parallel line is then 
the sales curve. his very simple case is, in reality, very common for 
the reason that most commodities are products, and that, generally, 
the producers put on sale the total quantity of their products or keep 
for themselves only an insigniicant fraction. In these conditions, the 
purchase curve has a very remarkable character: it becomes a curve

of the price as a function of the total quantity in existence, since its 
abscissas give the price of the commodity as a function of the total 
quantity in existence represented by its ordinates.
152. Instead of assuming that the original equilibrium established 
among (A), (C), (D),  and then introducing (B) and determining 
pb, we could have assumed there is equilibrium between (A), (B), 
(D),  and then introducing (C) and determining pc , or between 
(A), (B), (C),  and then introducing (D) and determining pd , and 
so forth. Consequently, each commodity can be considered as having 
a purchase curve that becomes, moreover, a price curve if we assume 
that supply is equal to the total quantity in existence and if, by vir-
tue of the law of the great numbers, we abstract from the condition 
of proportionality of demand and supply before and ater. he gen-
eral equation of this curve considered as purchase curve would be 
D = F( p); the general equation of this same curve considered as the 
price curve would be Q = F( p), so
p = F(Q),
if we assume the equation is solved with respect to the price. he 
purchase curve is exactly the one posited a priori by Cournot in his 
Recherches sur les principles mathématique de la théorie des richesses 
(1838) and that he calls the equation of the demand or of sales.i he 
curve lends itself to many applications.
153. he sales and purchase curves can be related to the equations of 
exchange in the following way.
Let (A) be the numeraire. And let, on the one hand, the commod-
ities (A), (C), (D),  be exchanged or be ready to be exchanged for 
one another at the established general equilibrium prices pc = π, 
pd = ρ,  of (C), (D),  in terms of (A). And, on the other hand, let 
the commodity (B) come onto the market to be exchanged for the 
commodities (A), (C), (D), .
heoretically, the appearance of (B) would have necessitated a new 
establishment of the system of equations of exchange (§ 121) with the 
introduction of a new variable pb and an additional equation


Purchase curves and sales curves 177
Fb (pb , pc , pd ,) = 0
that by designating, as we did before (§§ 125, 126), the sum of the 
positive ys by a function ∆b, hence Db , and, the sum of the negative 
ys by a function Ωb , hence Ob, we can put into the form
∆b ( pb , pc , pd ,) = Ωb ( pb , pc , pd ,).
However, if we abstract from the variations in the prices and the 
efective demands and supplies already determined, by considering 
them as constants, the irst member of the equation
∆b ( pb ,π,ρ,),
is a decreasing function of the single variable pb, and can be rep-
resented geometrically by a purchase curve BdBp (Fig. 20), and the 
second member,
Ωb ( pb ,π,ρ,),
is a successively increasing and decreasing function from zero to zero 
of the same single variable pb, that can be represented geometrically 
by a sales curve NP. he intersection of the two curves BdBp and NP 
in B will determine, at least approximately, the price pb = µ.
We will use the same procedure to connect the price curves with 
the equations of production.
154. Let us, before inishing, make an interesting observation regard-
ing a point discussed earlier. When the commodities in the market 
are numerous, the sales curve of each of them, even though it does 
not coincide exactly with the parallel of the total quantity in existence, 
will evidently approach it very closely, with the result that ordinarilyii 
there are not, in the case of the exchange of several commodities for 
one another, several current possible equilibrium prices, contrary to 
what happens in the case of the exchange of two commodities for 
each other (§ 68).

Notes
i Translated, in 1897, by Nathaniel T. Bacon, with the title Researches into the 
Principles of the heory of Wealth. he equation D = F(p) in question can be 
found on page 47. Cournot, however, does not discuss the inverse of F, as 
Walras does.
ii his is an important section. Jafé mistakenly translated ‘généralement’ as 
‘in general’, giving the impression that Walras meant ‘always; without excep-
tion’. In fact, it appears that he was leaving open the possibility that there 
may be several possible equilibria in the multi-commodity case. ‘Generally’ 
in English in this context means ‘ordinarily’ or ‘in most cases’. hat is also 
what ‘généralement’ means in French, as witness this dictionary deinition: 
‘Généralement ♦ Dans la plupart des cas, le plus souvent. ⇒ habituellement, 
ordinairement (cf. En général). Généralement, cela se passe ainsi.’ Walras 
did not use the words ‘en général’ here, contrary to Jafé’s implication, but 
even if he had, he would not necessarily, in French, have been stating ‘in 
every case’: ‘EN GÉNÉRAL: Parler en général, abstraction faite des cas 
spéciaux. « c’est l’homme en général et non tel homme qu’ils représentent » 
(Taine). – Dans la plupart des cas, le plus souvent. ⇒ communément, géné-
ralement. C’est en général ce qui arrive’ (Robert 2002, p. 1172).

LESSON 16

Exposition and refutation of Adam Smith’s 
and J.-B. Say’s doctrines of the origin of value 
in exchange

SUMMARy: – hree principal solutions of the problem of the ori-
gin of value. Doctrine of A. Smith, or, of labor. his doctrine is 
limited to stating that only labor has value; it does not in any way 
explain why labor has value, nor, consequently, from whence in 
general the value of things arises. Doctrine of J.-B. Say, or, of utility. 
Utility is a necessary condition of value, but not a suicient one. 
Doctrine of rareté. Gossen’s condition of maximum satisfaction: 
the maximum utility to which it refers is not the one achieved by 
free competition. Jevons’s equations of exchange: they are applic-
able only to the case of two exchangers.
155. here are, in the science of economics, three principal solutions 
to the problem of the origin of value. he irst is that of Adam Smith, 
Ricardo, and McCulloch; it is, it could be said, the English solution: 
it inds the origin of value in labor. his solution is too narrow and it 
denies that there is value in things that, in fact, do have it. he second 
is that of Condillac and J.-B. Say; it is, it could be said, the French solu-
tion: it inds the origin of value in utility. his solution is too broad 
and it inds value in things that do not, in fact, have it. Finally, the 
third, which is the right one, is the one espoused by Burlamaqui and 
my father, A.-A. Walras: it inds the origin of value in rareté.
156. Adam Smith formulated his doctrine in the following terms in 
Book I, Chapter V of the Wealth of Nations:
he real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who 
wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What everything 


180 heory of exchange

is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose 
of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can 
save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people. What is bought 
with money or with goods is purchased just as much by labour as what we 
acquire by the toil of our own body. hat money or those goods indeed save 
us this toil. hey contain the value of a certain quantity of labour which we 
exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the value of an equal 
quantity. Labour was the irst price, the original purchase-money that was 
paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labour, that all the 
wealth of the world was originally purchased; and its value, to those who 
possess it, and who want to exchange it for some new productions, is pre-
cisely equal to the quantity of labour which it can enable them to purchase 
or command.1
his theory has generally not been well refuted. It consists essen-
tially in the assertion that all things that have value and that are 
exchanged are labor in one form or another; that labor, in a word, 
constitutes by itself alone all of social wealth. Whereupon Adam 
Smith is instructed that there are certain things that have value and 
that are exchanged that are not the result of labor, and that there 
are things other than labor that are part of social wealth. But that 
answer is badly reasoned. Whether labor is by itself the entirety of 
social wealth, or is simply one species of it, is something that we do 
not yet know and that, in fact, is of little importance. In either case, 
why is labor worth anything and why is labor exchanged? hat is 
the question before us, and that is the question that A. Smith nei-
ther asked nor answered. Now, if labor has value and is exchanged, 
it is because it is both useful and limited in quantity, because it is 
scarce (§ 100). Value, thus, comes from rareté, and all things that 
are scarce, whether or not there are such things other than labor, 
that have value, and that are exchangeable like labor. herefore, the 
theory that inds the origin of value in labor is less a theory that 
is too narrow than a theory that is completely vacuous; it is cer-
tainly an incorrect declaration, but it is above all a statement that is 
unfounded.
157. As for the second solution, here are the words in which J.-B. Say 
formulated it:

1 A. Smith. Wealth of Nations, bk. 1, ch. V.


Smith’s and Say’s doctrines of the origins of value 181

Why does the utility of a thing make it have value?
Because the utility that it has makes it desirable and prompts men to 
make sacriices to possess it. No one will give anything in exchange to have 
something that is good for nothing; but everyone will give a certain quantity 
of the things he possesses (a certain amount of silver money, for example) 
in order to obtain the thing for which he feels the need. hat is what makes 
it have value.2
Here is at least an attempted demonstration, albeit, it must be 
admitted, a poor one. ‘he utility of a thing makes it desirable’. 
Certainly! ‘It prompts men to make sacriices to possess it.’ Well, 
that depends, for it will only prompt men to make sacriices if they 
cannot get the thing in any other way. ‘No one will give anything in 
exchange to have something that is good for nothing.’ No doubt! ‘But 
everyone will give a certain quantity of the things he possesses in 
order to obtain the thing for which he feels the need.’ on one con-
dition: namely, that he cannot get it without giving something in 
exchange. Utility, therefore, is not suicient to create value: in add-
ition it is necessary that the useful thing does not exist in unlimited 
quantities, that it is scarce. his reasoning is conirmed by facts. he 
air we breathe, the wind that ills the sails at sea or turns windmills 
on land, the sun that gives us light and heat and ripens our harvests 
and fruits, water and steam from heated water, and many other forces 
of nature are useful, even indispensable. And yet they have no value. 
Why? Because they are unlimited in quantity, because each of us can 
obtain all he wants of them, whenever they are present at all, without 
giving up anything or making any sacriice in return.
Condillac and J.-B. Say both met with this objection on the path 
they followed. hey each answered it in very diferent ways. Condillac 
considered air, light, and water very useful things, and he under-
took to demonstrate to us that they really cost us something. What 
would that be? he efort necessary to use them. For Condillac, the 
act of breathing, the act of opening one’s eyes to see the light, the 
act of stooping to take the water from a river are the sacriices that 
we pay for these goods. his puerile argument has been cited more 
oten than would be thought possible; but that does not make it a 
better argument. It is, in efect, evident that if we call these actions 

2 J.-B. Say, Catéchisme d’économie politique. Ch. II.


182 heory of exchange

economic sacriices, we shall have to ind another word for the sac-
riice associated with value properly so called; because when I go for 
meat to the butcher’s or for a suit to the tailor’s, I make an efort or a 
sacriice in acquiring these items, but I also make another very spe-
cial one, namely that of taking out of my pocket a certain sum of 
money for the merchant.
J.-B. Say regards the matter in a diferent way. Air, sunlight, the 
water of streams and rivers are useful, according to him, and, in con-
sequence, are valuable. hey are, indeed, so useful, so necessary, so 
indispensable that their value is great, immense, ininite. And that 
is precisely why we get them for nothing. We do not pay for them, 
because we could never pay what they are worth. he explanation is 
ingenious; unfortunately, there are cases in which air, light, water are 
paid for; that occurs when, in exceptional circumstances, they are 
scarce.
158. We have been able to ind, without too much trouble, in A. Smith 
and J.-B. Say, two characteristic passages; but it must be said that in 
reality these authors have only touched the surface of the question 
of the origin of value in exchange and that neither of them limited 
themselves to the inadequate theories that we have mentioned. A few 
lines ater the ones we have quoted, J.-B. Say turns his utility theory 
into one of labor; elsewhere he seems to come around to one of scar-
city. As for Adam Smith, he fortunately contradicted himself by pla-
cing land, like labor, among social wealth. only Bastiat undertook to 
systematize the English theory, and accepted, and tried to persuade 
others to accept, consequences that are very contrary to the reality of 
the facts.
159. Finally, there remains the theory of rareté, enunciated by 
Burlamaqui in the following excellent manner:
he foundations of inherent and intrinsic price are, irstly, the capacity 
that things have to serve our wants, our convenience, or pleasures of life; in 
a word, their utility and their scarcity.
I say irstly their utility, by which I mean not only real utility, but also 
utility that is only arbitrary or imaginary, like that of precious stones; and 
because of this circumstance it is commonly said that a thing that is of no 
use has no price.


Smith’s and Say’s doctrines of the origins of value 183

But utility alone, be it ever so real, does not suice to give a price to 
things; their scarcity must also be considered; that is to say, the diiculty of 
procuring these things, and the fact that no one can easily obtain as much 
as he wants of them.
Need alone is very far from determining the price of a thing; we usu-
ally see that those things that are the most necessary to human life are the 
cheapest, like ordinary water.
Scarcity alone is also not suicient to give price to things; they must also 
be of some use.
Just as these circumstances are the true foundations of the price of things, 
it is also these same circumstances combined in diferent ways that cause 
the price to rise or fall.
If a thing goes out of fashion, or if fewer people care for it, it will become 
cheap, however dear it may have been before. on the other hand, as soon 
as an ordinary thing, that costs little or nothing, becomes scarce, it imme-
diately begins to have a price and sometimes becomes even very dear, as 
happens, for example, to water in arid regions or sometimes during a siege 
or during a sea voyage, etc.
In a word, all the special circumstances that cause a thing to have a high 
price can be shown to be related to their scarcity. Such special circum-
stances are the diiculty of making the thing, its intricacy, the reputation 
of the artisan.
We can subsume under the same reason what we call the sentimental 
or afective price when, because of some special circumstance, we value a 
thing we possess more highly than the price that is ordinarily paid for it; for 
example, if it has served to save us from a great danger, if it is a souvenir of 
some remarkable event, if it is a mark of honor, etc.3
hat is the doctrine of scarcity. Abbé Genovesi taught it at Naples 
in the middle of the eighteenth century, and Nassau W. Senior at 
oxford about 1830. But it was really my father who introduced it 
into economics, by presenting it in a special way with all the neces-
sary developments, and by defending it against all the opposing doc-
trines, in his book titled De la nature de la richesse et de l’origine de la 
valeur.i No one could have done that better than my father did in that 
book using the resources of ordinary logic, and, to advance matters 
a bit further, it is necessary to use the techniques of mathematical 
analysis, as I have done.

160.4 But I am not the only one to have had recourse to those tech-
niques to achieve the same goal. others have done it before me: the 
irst was a German, Hermann-Heinrich Gossen, in a work titled 
Entwiekelung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs, und der daraus 
liessenden Regeln für menschlichen Handeln, published in 1854; then 
an Englishman, William Stanley Jevons, in a work titled heory of 
Political Economy, the irst edition of which appeared in 1871 and the 
second in 1879. Both Gossen and Jevons, the latter without having 
any knowledge of the work of the former, postulated the decreasing 
utility or want curve; and Gossen deduced mathematically from it 
the condition of maximum utility, while Jevons deduced mathemat-
ically the equations of exchange.
Gossen stated the condition of maximum utility in these terms: – 
he two commodities must, ater exchange, be so divided between the 
two exchangers that the last atom received of each commodity has the 
same value for each exchanger (p. 85). To translate this statement 
into our formulas, we shall call the two commodities (A) and (B), 
and the two exchangers (1) and (2). Let r = ϕa,1 (q) and r = ϕb,1 (q) 
be the equations of the utility curves of commodities (A) and (B) 
for exchanger (1), and r = ϕa,2 (q) and r = ϕb,2 (q) be the correspond-
ing equations for exchanger (2). Let qa be the quantity of (A) pos-
sessed by exchanger (1) and qb be the quantity of (B) possessed by 
exchanger (2); and let da and db be the quantities of (A) and (B) to be 
exchanged. Under these conditions, Gossen’s wording can be trans-
lated by the two equations
ϕa,1 (qa − da ) = ϕa,2 (da )
ϕb,1 (db ) = ϕb,2 (qb − db )
that determine da and db for exchangers (1) and (2). Now, it is very 
obvious that the maximum utility attained in this way is not the rela-
tive maximum utility of free competition, compatible with the con-
dition that all exchangers give and receive the two commodities in a 
4 I repeat, to prevent any misunderstanding, that I added this section to the second 
edition of my book, and that if I did not cite, in the irst edition in 1874, the three 
works mentioned here that appeared before mine, it was because I was com-
pletely ignorant of their existence.


Smith’s and Say’s doctrines of the origins of value 185

common and identical proportion, but rather an absolute maximum 
that takes no account of the condition of a single price.
As for Jevons, he formulated his equations of exchange as fol-
lows: – he ratio of exchange of the two commodities will be the 
inverse of the ratio of the inal degrees of utility of the quantities 
of commodity available for consumption ater the exchange (Ed. 2, 
p. 103). Letting (A) and (B) be the two commodities, (1) and (2) 
the two exchangers, ϕ1 and ψ1 the letters for the utility functions of 
(A) and (B) for exchanger (1), ϕ2 and ψ2 the corresponding letters 
for exchanger (2), a the quantity of (A) possessed by exchanger (I), 
and b the quantity of (B) possessed by exchanger (2), and x and y 
the quantities of (A) and (B) to be exchanged, Jevons translated his 
own wording into the two equations

and would serve to determine da and db. his formula difers from 
ours in two respects. In the irst place, the prices that are the inverse 
ratios of the quantities of the commodities exchanged are replaced 
by the ratios of exchange that are the direct ratios of these quantities 
and that are always furnished by the two terms, da and db. In the 
second place, the problem is considered as being resolved with the 
case of two exchangers. he author simply reserved the right to con-
sider each of these exchangers (trading bodies) as being made up of a 
group of individuals, for example, of all the inhabitants of a contin-
ent, of all the manufacturers in a certain industry of a given country 
(p. 95). But he himself recognized that in making such a hypothesis, 
he let the terrain of reality to place himself on that of ictitious means 
(p. 97). As for us, wanting to remain on the former, we cannot accept 
Jevons’s formula as valid except for the limited case where only two 
individuals are present. For this limited case, Jevons’s formula is 
identical to ours, except for his substitution of quantities exchanged 


186 heory of exchange

in place of prices. It remains therefore to introduce the general case 
in which any number of individuals come together to exchange, irst, 
two commodities for each other, and then in which any number of 
commodities are exchanged for one another. hat is what Jevons did 
not do, and it is precisely what he was prohibited from doing by his 
attachment to the unfortunate idea of taking the quantities exchanged 
as the unknowns of the problem instead of the prices.
I have criticized only a special point of the doctrine of my pred-
ecessors. I should add immediately that Gossen’s conception of the 
intensity of the last want satisied, under the name Werth des letzten 
Atoms and by Jevons under the name Final Degree of Utility, enabled 
them to clarify other important points, and that their works should 
be read with the greatest care by economists who are desirous of 
working on the deinitive construction of economic theory.
At the same time that Jevons irst published his heory of 
Political Economy, that is, in 1871 and 1872, Mr. Carl Menger, 
Professor at the University of Vienna, published his Grundsätze der 
Volkswirthschatslehre, which is a third work that preceded mine in 
which the foundations of the new theory of exchange are set forth in 
an independent and original manner. Mr. Menger developed, as we 
did, the utility theory, in setting forth the law of the decrease of wants 
with the quantity consumed, for the purpose of drawing the theory of 
exchange from it. He followed the deductive method, but was opposed 
to following the mathematical method, although he made use, if not 
of functions or curves, at least of arithmetical tables to express either 
utility or demand. his makes it impossible for me to comment upon 
his theory in a few lines as I did for Gossen and Jevons. I shall only 
say that he and the authors that followed his teachings, like Professor 
Frederic de Wieser, of Prague, in his work Ueber den Ursprung und 
die Hauptgesetze des wirthschatlichen Werthes (1894) and Professor 
Eugène von Bœhm-Bawerk, in his Grundzüge der heorie des wirt-
schatlichen Güterwerts (1886), seem to me to deprive themselves of 
a precious and even indispensible resource by refusing a straightfor-
ward use of the method and language of mathematics in treating an 
essentially mathematical subject. Nevertheless, I will add that with the 
imperfect method and language that they employ, they have perhaps 
more irmly grasped the problem of exchange than did Gossen and 
Jevons. What is sure is that they have at least succeeded in bringing 


Smith’s and Say’s doctrines of the origins of value 187

the theory of scarcity, or, as they say, of Grenznutzen (inal utility), 
sharply to the attention of economists in Germany. his theory is 
now being developed in economic science and has a very promising 
future. I have drawn from it, as has been seen, the theory of the deter-
mination of the prices of commodities. I am going to draw from it, as 
will be seen: 1o the theory of the simultaneous determination of the 
prices of products and the prices of land services, personal services, 
and capital services, and 2o the theory of the determination of the 
rate of net income and, as a consequence, of landed capital, personal 
capital, and capital goods.

LESSON 17

Capital and income. he three services

SUMMARy: – Commodities considered as products. Having 
obtained the law of supply and demand, we now seek the law of 
costs of production, or, of average cost. Capital goods, a type of 
social wealth used more than once; income, a kind of social wealth 
that is used only once. Capital goods and income considered as 
to their nature or as to their purpose, material or immaterial. he 
low of services of capital are incomes. Consumable services; pro-
ductive services.
Land and its services, or, landed capital and its services. Persons 
and labor, or, personal capital and its services. Capital goods prop-
erly speaking and ‘proits’,i or, movableii capital and its services. 
Incomes. Land, a type of capital existing in approximately constant 
quantity. Persons, a type of capital that disappears and reappears 
independently of trends of consumption and industrial produc-
tion. Capital goods properly speaking, a type of capital produced 
[as a function of economic conditions]. Having obtained the prices 
of products, we now seek the prices of productive services.
161. However complicated an order of phenomena may be, and the 
order of economic phenomena is surely that to a high degree, there 
is always a means of studying it scientiically provided that the rule 
that prescribes going from the simple to the complex is observed. 
I have followed that rule in constructing the mathematical theory 
of exchange, by passing from the exchange of two commodities for 
each other to the exchange of any number of commodities for each 
other with the intervention of a numeraire. In doing so, I let out of 
consideration the fact that commodities are products resulting from 


192 heory of production

the combination of productive factors such as land, men, and capital 
goods. he moment has come to introduce and pose, ater the prob-
lem of the mathematical determination of the prices of products, 
that of the mathematical determination of the prices of productive 
services. he solving of the former problem and of the equations of 
exchange brought us to the scientiic formula of the law of supply 
and demand. he solving of the latter problem and of the equations 
of production will bring us to the scientiic formula of the law of the 
cost of production, or, of average cost. hus I found the two great laws 
of economics; except that, rather than putting them in competition 
and in opposition to one another in the matter of the determination 
of prices, I made them each play their part by basing on the irst 
the determination of the prices of products, and on the second the 
determination of the prices of productive services. It is certain, as 
economists have recognized, and – I hope will be believed – as has 
not completely escaped me, that in a certain normal and ideal state, 
the price of commodities is equal to their average cost. In that state, 
the state of equilibrium of exchange and of production, a bottle of 
wine that sells for 5 francs cost to produce 2 francs in rent, 2 francs 
in wages, and 1 franc in interest. It remains to be seen whether it is 
because 2 francs were paid out in rent, 2 francs in wages, and 1 franc 
in interest that this bottle of wine sells for 5 francs, or whether it is 
because the bottle sells for 5 francs that 2 francs were paid out in rent, 
2 francs in wages, and 1 franc in interest. It remains to determine, in 
a word, if it is, as has been maintained, the prices of productive ser-
vices that determine the prices of products, or if it is not rather the 
prices of products, determined, as we have seen, by virtue of the law 
of supply and demand, that determine the prices of productive ser-
vices by virtue of the law of costs of production, or, of average cost. 
hat is the subject that we are going to examine.
162. here are three productive services. When they refer to these 
factors, authors most frequently employ the terms land, labor, and 
capital. But these names are not suiciently rigorous to serve as a 
basis for rational deductions. Labor is the service of personal fac-
ulties or of persons; it is necessary, therefore, to place alongside it, 
not land and capital, but land services or the services of land, and 
capital good services or the services of capital goods. Since I use these 


Capital and income. he three services 193

terms in a way not exactly diferent from but a little narrower than is 
ordinarily done, I must deine them carefully. To this end, I must irst 
introduce the deinition of capital and of income.
163. I call capital in general, as my father did in his héorie de la 
richesse sociale (1849), all forms of social wealth that are not used 
up at all or are used up only ater a period of time, i.e., every utility 
limited in quantity that outlasts the irst use made of it; in a word, 
that is used more than once: a house, a piece of furniture. And I call 
income all kinds of social wealth that are used up immediately, every 
scarce thing that no longer exists ater the irst service that it yields; 
in brief, that is usable only once: bread, meat. Among these incomes 
are included, alongside items privately consumed, the raw materials 
of agriculture and industry: seeds, textile ibers, etc. he duration in 
question here is not, in efect, material duration, but the duration of 
usefulness or economic duration. Textile ibers still continue to exist 
materially in the cloth; but they have disappeared as primary mate-
rials, and cannot serve a second time in the same capacity. on the 
other hand, buildings and machines are capital goods, not income. 
I add that while certain kinds of social wealth are naturally capital 
and other kinds are naturally income, there is also a large number of 
kinds that are either capital or income depending upon how they are 
used or the service required of them. Trees, for example, are capital 
when they bear fruit, but are income when they are cut down for fuel 
or lumber. Animals, too, are capital when they work or give milk or 
eggs, but are income when they are slaughtered for food. It is always 
the case that, whether by nature or by purpose, each useful thing lim-
ited in quantity, each scarce thing, either serves more than once or 
serves only once, and is, in consequence, either capital or income.
When we speak of people who consume their capital, we mean 
that they irst exchange their capital for income and that they con-
sume the income. Similarly to capitalize their income, they must 
exchange it for capital goods.
Capital must not be confused with stocks, which are sums of income 
prepared in advance for consumption. Wine in the cellar, wood in 
the woodshed are stocks. Minerals, stones in mines and quarries are 
also accumulations of income and not of capital. Ater a little relec-
tion, it is impossible to make a mistake on this matter.


194 heory of production

164. Since we have called social wealth the ensemble of material or 
immaterial things that are scarce; that is to say, are both useful and 
limited in quantity (§ 21), we hardly need to say that the capital and 
income into which we are dividing that same social wealth are them-
selves either material or immaterial. he materiality or immaterial-
ity is unimportant to us in either case. We will see presently how 
capital engenders income; we will then also see that material capital 
may very well engender immaterial income, and immaterial capital 
engender material income. I mention this fact now because it lends 
support to the distinction that has been made between capital and 
income.
165. It is of the essence of capital to give birth to income; and it is 
of the essence of income to be given birth, directly or indirectly, by 
capital. Here is how this happens. Capital, by deinition, outlasts the 
irst use made of it; several successive uses are therefore made of it; 
the low of these uses is evidently a low of incomes. A piece of land 
will grow our crops every year; a house will shelter us, in winter as 
in summer, from inclemencies of the weather; this fecundity of land, 
this shelter provided by the house constitutes their annual income. A 
worker is active in the workshop every day; a lawyer, a doctor see cli-
ents daily; that work, those consultations are the daily incomes pro-
duced by those individuals. It is the same regarding the incomes of 
machines, instruments, tools, furniture, and clothing. he thought of 
many writers is obscure and confused as a result of failing to consider 
capital and its incomes separately.
In order to distinguish them, we will give the name of services to 
those incomes that consist of the uses made of capital. here are two 
sorts of them. here are those that are used up without being changed 
in the course of either private or public consumption: examples of 
these services are the shelter of the house, the consultation of the 
lawyer, of the doctor, the use of furniture, clothing. hese we will 
call consumable services. And there are those that are transformed 
by means of agriculture, industry, or commerce into incomes or cap-
ital; that is to say, into products: examples of these services are the 
fertility of the soil, the labor of the workman, the use of machines, 
instruments, tools. hese we will call productive services. his dis-
tinction corresponds closely to the distinction made by most authors 


Capital and income. he three services 195

between unproductive and reproductive consumption. he distinc-
tion will presently be made clearer. Moreover, the question to be 
studied here especially is the transformation of productive services 
into products.
166. By means of the deinition of capital and income, we can start by 
dividing the whole of social wealth into four main categories, three 
of which are categories of capital, and one of which is the category 
of income.
We put land into the irst category: land used for parks and gar-
dens, public and private; land that produces trees and all sorts of 
vegetal matter for nourishing man and animals: fruits, vegetables, 
cereals, fodder; land that supports homes or public buildings, oices, 
factories, workshops, or shops; land used for means of transporta-
tion: roads, highways, public squares, canals, railways. All this land 
is truly capital. he garden and the park, bare during the winter, will 
grow green again and have blossoms again in the summer; the land 
that was productive this season will be productive again in the next 
season; that which has supported a house or factory this year will 
support it again the following year; we will use the street and the 
road in the coming year as in the year past. hus the land outlasts the 
irst use that is made of it, and the succession of its uses constitutes 
its income. he enjoyment of a walk and the view is the income of 
the park or the garden; the productive power is the income from land 
that is used; the site made available for buildings is the income from 
land so used; the facilitation of moving from one place to another is 
the income from streets and roads. hus we have our irst category of 
capital, landed capital or land, capable of furnishing income, namely 
land income, which we will also call land services.
167. We place persons into the second category: those who do noth-
ing other than travel and seek amusement; and those who serve 
other persons: coachmen, cooks, valets, maids; public oicials in 
the service of the State, such as administrators, judges, military 
persons; male and female workers in agriculture, industry, and 
commerce; men engaged in the liberal professions, such as lawyers, 
doctors, artists. All these persons are truly capital. he idler who has 
lounged about today will lounge about tomorrow; the blacksmith 


196 heory of production

who has just inished his day will inish many more; the lawyer who 
leaves the courtroom will come back to plead again. hus, persons 
still exist ater rendering their irst service, and the series of ser-
vices they render constitutes their income. he pleasure enjoyed 
by the idler, the task performed by the artisan, the pleading of the 
lawyer are the incomes of these people. We have therefore a second 
category of capital, personal capital or persons, capable of furnish-
ing their incomes, their incomes or personal services, which we will 
also call labor.
168. We now place into the third category all the remaining assets 
that are capital assets and that are neither land nor persons: homes 
in either town or country, public buildings; business buildings, fac-
tories, workshops, shops, constructions of all kinds, considered, of 
course, apart from the ground on which they stand; trees and plants 
of all sorts; animals; furniture, clothes, pictures, statues, carriages, 
jewelry; machines, instruments, tools. We assume that all these 
things are not income, but are capital itself productive of income. he 
house that shelters me now can shelter me for a long time to come; 
my paintings, my jewelry are always at my disposal; the train and its 
freight cars that today have brought passengers and goods from a 
neighboring town, will return tomorrow along the same tracks, with 
other passengers and other goods. Moreover, the shelter provided 
by a house, the decorative efect of paintings and jewels, the trans-
portation furnished by the train and its freight cars are the incomes 
from the capital goods. hus we have a third category of capital, mov-
able capital goods or capital goods properly speaking, ready to pro-
vide incomes, the incomes or movable services that we will also call 
‘proits’.
169. All of capital being accounted for by our irst three categories of 
social wealth, in the fourth category there are only incomes: things 
that are consumediii such as wheat, lour, bread, meat, wine, beer, veg-
etables, fruit, fuels for lighting and for the warmth of consumers; raw 
materials such as fertilizers, seeds, metals, lumber, textiles, cloth, fuel 
for lighting and heat in businesses, all things destined to disappear as 
raw materials in order to reappear as products.


Capital and income. he three services 197

170. We see that land, persons, and capital goods properly speaking are 
capital; the services of land, the services of persons, or labor, the ser-
vices of capital goods properly speaking, are incomes. It is necessary, 
therefore, in order to be exact and precise, to recognize as productive 
services three sorts of capital and incomes: the capital and income of 
land, of persons, and of capital goods properly speaking; namely land 
and land services, persons and labor, and capital goods properly speak-
ing and ‘proits’.iv In this corrected form, the current classiications can 
be accepted. hey are now based on the nature of things.
Land is natural capital and not artiicial or produced. It is also 
unconsumable capital; it is not destroyed by usage or destroyed by 
accidents. here is, however, some landed capital that has been arti-
icially produced by putting soil over rock surfaces, by fertilizing 
land, by draining marshes; and there is also some that is destroyed 
as a result of earthquakes, the low of rivers, or torrents. But such 
cases are small in number; and we can, with few exceptions, consider 
landed capital as capital that is not consumed and as capital that is 
not produced. Each of those two circumstances has an importance of 
its own; but it is above all their coexistence that gives landed capital 
its own and special character. It results from those circumstances, in 
fact, that the quantity of land is, if not a quantity rigorously constant, 
at least a quantity only slightly variable; that, as a result, the quantity 
of land can be very considerable in a primitive society, but, on the 
contrary, very limited in an advanced society, relatively to the quan-
tity of persons and to the quantity of capital goods properly speaking; 
that, in consequence, land can be, and we will see that it is in reality, 
not scarce and has no value in the former case, and has a high degree 
of scarcity and value in the latter case.
171. Persons, like land, are also natural capital, but they are consum-
able capital; that is to say, destructible by use or by accidents. hey dis-
appear, but they reappear, through the process of reproduction. hus 
their quantity, far from being constant, is susceptible of indeinite 
increase under certain conditions. Regarding them, we must make 
an observation. In saying that persons are natural capital and that 
they reappear through reproduction, we are taking account of the 
principle of social ethics that is more and more generally accepted 


198 heory of production

that persons should not be bought and sold like things, and that they 
cannot be produced in farms or in stud farms like cattle or horses. 
on those grounds, it might be thought of no use to include them in 
a theory of the determination of prices. But, irst, although personal 
capital is not bought and sold, personal income, i.e., labor, is supplied 
and demanded every day in markets, and therefore personal capital 
can, and oten must, at least be evaluated. And, second, we are not 
afraid of recalling that economic theory is, ater all, based upon mak-
ing complete abstraction from the point of view of justice as well as 
of economic advantageousness, and upon considering personal cap-
ital, like land and movable capital, exclusively from the point of view 
of value in exchange. We will therefore continue to speak of the price 
of labor and even of the price of persons, without taking any position 
either for or against slavery.
172. Capital goods properly speaking are artiicial capital or prod-
ucts and are consumable capital. It is, perhaps, possible to cite some 
examples of capital assets, other than land and persons, that are 
natural assets: certain trees, certain animals; but hardly any can be 
found that are inconsumable. hey are destroyed and perish, like 
persons; but, also like persons, they reappear, not as a result of nat-
ural reproduction, but as a result of economic production. heir 
quantity, like that of persons, is, therefore, susceptible of an indein-
ite increase under given conditions. We have again an observation to 
make regarding them. Capital goods are always associated with land 
in industry, particularly in agricultural industry. It should be clearly 
understood, however, that when we speak of land, we consider it 
apart from dwellings or oice buildings, from enclosing or support-
ing walls, from irrigation and drainage systems, in a word, from all 
capital goods properly speaking, and, with all the more reason, apart 
from fertilizers, seeds, unharvested crops, in short, apart from all the 
incomes that accompany them; and that it is exclusively the services 
of land thus considered that we call land services, reserving the name 
of ‘proits’ for the services rendered by capital goods properly speak-
ing that are associated with land.
he above characteristics of social wealth have a signiicance that 
not only explains but justiies the distinction between land, persons, 
and capital goods properly speaking. It has to be said, however, that 


Capital and income. he three services 199

this signiicance will become evident principally in social economics, 
and, regarding the matters that are the concern of economic theory, 
in the part devoted to the study of the conditions and consequences 
of economic progress. In all this, the only circumstance that the ana-
lysis will assume will be that the landed capital, personal capital, and 
movable capital are capital and not income.
173. hat said, we still have to inquire why and how it happens that, 
in an economic society governed by a regime of free competition in 
regard to production as in regard to exchange, there are, for the ser-
vices of land, for the services of personal faculties (or labor), for the 
services of capital goods properly speaking (or ‘proits’), equilibrium 
prices that are mathematical quantities; we have to formulate the sys-
tem of equations of which rent, wages, and interest are the roots. he 
importance of this study is not fully evident unless it is remembered 
that in current economic theory there are at present ive or ten theor-
ies of rent, which amounts precisely to saying that there is no theory 
of rent, no more than there are theories of wages or of interest.

Notes
i When the word ‘proits’ is used in Walras’s special sense, namely as the ser-
vices of capital goods properly speaking, it will be put in quotation marks. 
otherwise, it will have the conventional modern meaning of the excess of 
revenue over costs.
ii Walras uses the adjective ‘mobilier’ in a special sense. We have translated 
that word as ‘movable’, which is correct, but it must be remembered that 
‘capitaux mobiliers’ include all goods other than land that produce prod-
ucts or services. his broad deinition therefore places houses and trees, 
for example, in the category of movable capital goods. hey can be moved, 
although only with diiculty. Moreover, to underscore the fact that Walras 
intended his deinitions to identify a principal characteristic of most par-
ticular cases, land, which he diferentiates from movable capital goods, can, 
in many cases, be moved in the sense that earth and stones can be moved 
from one location to another.
iii he examples Walras gives in this section of ‘objets de consommation’, or 
consumption goods, are only ones that have physical mass, unlike services. 
‘Goods’, as distinct from services, are ‘commodities that are tangible, usually 
movable, and generally not consumed at the same time as they are pro-
duced’. Like ‘investment goods’, there are ‘consumer goods’ or ‘consumption 


200 heory of production

goods’. Some authors write ‘consumers’ goods’ or even ‘consumer’s goods’, 
but those are abuses of language, just as writing ‘investors’ goods’ would be. 
he commodity name is not possessive. A consumption good is not used 
directly to make other goods; it is what it is, whether possessed by a con-
sumer or stored in a warehouse or shop or on display in a shop.
iv his is badly written. Walras contradicts his deinitions and usage by writ-
ing that capital is a service. It is perhaps best to understand his sentence in 
this way: ‘It is necessary, therefore, in order to be exact and precise, to rec-
ognize as the elements of production three sorts of capital and their incomes: 
the capital and income of land, of persons, and of capital goods properly 
speaking; namely land and land services, persons and labor, and capital 
goods properly speaking and “proits”.’ he italicized words are ours.

only capital goods can be hired out. he hiring out of cap-
ital is the sale of its service. Landowners; workers; capitalists. 
Entrepreneurs. he market for services: rent, wages, interest. he 
market for products. he two markets, while distinct from each 
other, are related. he equilibrium of production preassumes the 
equilibrium of exchange on the two markets and the equality of 
the price of the products to their average cost, the entrepreneurs 
not making either proit or loss.
174. Just as, in taking up the problem of the mathematical determin-
ation of the prices of products, we had to deine with precision the 
mechanism of free competition as regards exchange, in taking up the 
problem of the mathematical deinition of the prices of productive 
services, we must similarly carefully examine the facts and experi-
ence, asking them to provide an accurate notion of the mechanism 
of free competition as regards production. Now, if, for the needs of 
this analysis, we assume the process of economic production in a 


202 heory of production

given country to be momentarily halted, we can, in combining the 
distinction between consumable services and productive services 
(§ 165) with the enumeration of capital and income (§§ 166, 167, 
168, 169), classify the elements of that process under the following 
13 headings.
We have, in regard to capital, the following:
1, 2, and 3: Landed capital, personal capital, and movable capital 
productive of consumer services; that is to say, of income directly 
consumed either by the owners of these diferent types of capital 
themselves or by those who acquire the income derived from them, 
be they individuals, or communities, or the State. hus we have, as 
landed capital: parks and gardens; ground supporting houses or pub-
lic buildings; streets, roads, public squares; ― as personal capital: idle 
persons, servants, government workers; ― as movable capital goods: 
houses, public buildings; trees, plants and domestic animals; furni-
ture, clothes, art objects, luxury goods.
4, 5, and 6: Landed capital, personal capital and movable capital 
goods yielding productive services; that is to say, income commod-
ities transformable into products through agriculture, industry, or 
trade. hus, as landed capital: farm land, ground supporting oice 
buildings, factories, workshops, or shops; ― as personal capital: 
wage-earners, professional men; ― as movable capital goods: farm 
buildings, factories, workshops, stores; fruit-bearing trees and plants; 
work animals; machines, instruments, tools.
7: New movable capital goods unproductive of income for the 
moment, held for sale by their producers in the form of such prod-
ucts: houses and buildings newly constructed for sale; plants, animals, 
furniture, clothes, art objects, luxury goods, machines, instruments, 
tools in warehouses or on display in shops.
We have, in regard to income, the following:
8: Stocks of income goods consisting of consumer goods held by 
consumers. hus: bread, meat, wine, vegetables, fruit, oils, and 
irewood.
9: Stocks of income goods consisting of raw materials held by pro-
ducers. hus: fertilizers, seeds, metals, lumber, textiles iber, cloth in 
bolts, industrial fuels.


Elements and mechanism of production 203

10: New income goods consisting of consumer goods and raw mate-
rials held for sale by their producers. hus: bread at the baker’s, meat 
at the butcher’s; metals, lumber, textile ibers, bolts of cloth in ware-
houses or on display in shops.
Finally, we have, with respect to money:
11, 12, and 13: Transactions balances of money held by consumers; 
transactions balances of money held by producers; money savings.
It can be seen without diiculty that we obtain our irst six head-
ings by introducing into the discussion of each of the three kinds 
of capital the distinction between capital yielding consumable ser-
vices and capital yielding productive services; the seventh by put-
ting aside capital goods properly speaking that are not productive of 
income; the eighth, ninth, and tenth, on the one hand, and the elev-
enth, twelth, and thirteenth, on the other, by similarly introducing 
the distinction between income goods and money. We place money 
in a separate category, apart from capital and income, because of the 
mixed role it plays in production. From the point of view of society, 
money is capital, since it is used in society more than once for mak-
ing payments; from the point of view of individuals, it is income, 
because they can use it only once, since they no longer have it ater it 
has served once to make a payment.
175. We have assumed that the process of economic production is 
halted for a moment. Now let us assume it is set in motion again.
Among the items classiied under the irst six headings, land, 
which is unconsumable, will not be destroyed nor perish; men will 
die and men will be born in accordance with the rhythm of popu-
lation changes, independently of luctuations in agricultural, indus-
trial, and commercial production, although not, however, as we will 
see, without any relation with economic production; capital goods 
properly speaking, which is destructible by usage, and can perish in 
accidents, will be used up or will disappear, but is replaced by the new 
capital goods properly speaking classiied under the seventh head-
ing. hus, the quantity of the latter will be reduced in those ways, but 
will be restored by production. We can, in order to simplify the given 
conditions of the problem and with the proviso of returning later to 


204 heory of production

the matter, abstract from the seventh heading, and assume that the 
new movable capital goods pass into the third and sixth categories as 
soon as they are produced.
he items classiied under the eighth and ninth headings, con-
sumer goods and raw materials, which are immediately consumable 
income goods, will be consumed, but will be replaced by the new 
income goods classiied under the tenth heading. hus, the quantity 
of the latter will consequently decrease, but will be restored by pro-
duction. We can again abstract from the tenth category by assum-
ing that the new income goods pass, as soon as they are produced, 
into the eighth and ninth categories. We may even abstract from the 
eighth and ninth categories by assuming that consumer goods and 
raw materials are consumed as soon as they are produced, without 
previously being stored.
Money will intervene in exchanges. At each moment, part of cir-
culating money will be absorbed by savings, and part of money sav-
ings will be injected back into circulation by credit. If we abstract 
from the fact of saving, we can abstract from money saving. We will 
see presently that we can also abstract from circulating money.
176. In summary, what are consumed are the consumable services 
immediately reproduced by the landed capital, personal capital, 
and movable capital goods classiied under headings 1, 2, and 3, 
and the consumable income goods, uninished consumer goods, 
and raw materials, immediately reproduced by the landed cap-
ital, personal capital, and movable capital goods classiied under 
headings 4, 5, and 6. Income, by deinition, does not exist ater the 
irst service that it renders. When its service is required of it, it 
is going to perish; in technical terms, it is going to be consumed. 
Bread and meat will be eaten; wine will be drunk; oil and wood 
will be burned; fertilizers and seeds will be put in the soil; metals, 
lumber, and textile ibers will be processed, fuels will be used up. 
But no sooner will these income goods disappear than they will 
reappear as a result of the functioning of capital. Capital, by def-
inition, outlasts the irst use made of it. When they are put to the 
successive services for which they are designed, they will render 
them; technically speaking, they will produce. Farm land will be 


Elements and mechanism of production 205

cultivated; ground will support businesses; workers will work in 
those businesses; they will use their machines, instruments, and 
tools. In short, landed capital, personal capital, and movable capital 
goods will render their land services, their personal services, and 
their capital good services; and, from a combination of these land 
services, these personal services, and these capital good services, 
agriculture, industry, and commerce will draw new income goods 
to replace the income goods consumed.
177. But even that is not enough to exhaust the subject, because, 
as well as the consumer goods and the raw materials that are con-
sumed immediately, there are various kinds of capital goods prop-
erly speaking that are consumed slowly. Houses and buildings 
depreciate, furniture, clothes, art objects, and luxury goods wear 
out. he same is true of farm buildings, machines, instruments, and 
tools. All these capital goods are depreciated more or less rapidly 
by usage; they are also all subject to destruction in a sudden and 
unpredictable manner by unforeseeable accidents. Consequently, it 
is not enough that the landed capital, personal capital, and mov-
able capital goods under headings (4), (5), and (6) produce new 
income; it is also necessary that they produce new movable capital 
goods in replacement of the movable capital goods used up, new 
movable capital goods in replacement of movable capital goods 
accidentally destroyed, and even, if possible, new movable capital 
goods to increase the quantity of existing movable capital goods. 
And, in that respect, we can already point to one of the traits of eco-
nomic progress. Let us assume, in efect, that at the end of a certain 
period of time we again halt for a moment, as we have already done, 
the process of economic production, and that we ind an enlarged 
quantity of movable capital goods. hat would be a sign of a pro-
gressive state. hus, one of the traits of economic progress consists 
of an increase of the quantity of movable capital goods. Since our 
following part will be specially consecrated to the study of the con-
ditions and consequences of economic progress, we can reserve for 
later study the question of the production of new capital goods and 
restrict ourselves for the moment to that of the production of new 
income goods: consumer goods, and raw materials.


206 heory of production

178. he production of consumable income and of movable capital 
goods by productive capital is accomplished by the functioning of the 
latter, not in isolation but always in combination with other factors 
of production. Even in agriculture, where the role of landed capital is 
preponderant, the products are composed not only of land services, 
but also of labor and capital good services. And even in manufac-
turing, where, by contrast, the role of capital goods is predominant, 
rent enters into the composition of products along with labor and 
capital good services. Perhaps without exception, in order to prod-
uce anything, it is necessary to have land, even if only to provide 
support under the feet of the worker, personal faculties, and some 
kind of tool, which is capital. he cooperation of land, man, and cap-
ital is therefore the very essence of economic production. It is this 
collaboration that now requires clear deinition; but the distinction 
between capital and income, which has enabled us to classify the fac-
tors of production (§ 174), is also going to enable us to summarize 
its mechanism.
179. Income, simply because it does not outlast the irst service that it 
yields, can only be sold or given away. It cannot be hired out, at least 
not in kind. How can bread or meat be hired out? A capital good, on 
the contrary, simply because it outlasts the irst use that is made of it, 
can be hired out, either for a consideration or free of charge. hus, a 
house, a piece of furniture can be sold or given away, and it can also 
be rented. And what is the reason for the latter action? It is to procure 
the enjoyment of the service for the renter. he hiring out of a capital 
good is the alienation of the service of that capital good. Fundamental 
deinition, based entirely on the distinction between capital and 
income, and without which the theory of production and the theory 
of credit are impossible. he renting out of a capital good for a pay-
ment is the sale of its service, and letting it out for nothing is the git 
of its service. In fact, it is by being rented out for a payment that items 
of landed capital, personal capital, and movable capital goods classi-
ied under headings 4, 5, and 6 are combined for production.
180. Let us call the owner of land a landowner, whomever he may 
be, the owner of personal faculties a worker, and the owner of cap-
ital goods properly speaking a capitalist. And now, let us call a fourth 


Elements and mechanism of production 207

person an entrepreneur, entirely distinct from the preceding, and 
whose distinctive role is to lease land from the landowner, personal 
faculties from the worker, and capital from the capitalist, and to com-
bine the three productive services in agriculture, industry, or com-
merce. It is undoubtedly true that, in real life, the same individual can 
assume concurrently two or three of the above-deined roles, or even 
assume concurrently all four of them, and that the diversity of these 
combinations engenders the diversity of types of enterprises; but it is 
equally certain that he then fulills two, three, or four distinct roles. 
From the scientiic point of view, we must therefore distinguish these 
roles, and avoid both the error of the English economists who identify 
the entrepreneur with the capitalist, and that of a certain number of 
French economists that make the entrepreneur a worker by consider-
ing him as specially charged with the work of direction of the irm.
181. hat having been set forth, we must, as a consequence of this 
irst conception of the role of the entrepreneur, conceive of two dis-
tinct markets.
he irst is the market for services. here landowners, workers, 
and capitalists meet as sellers and entrepreneurs as buyers of pro-
ductive services, that is, of land services, labor, and capital good ser-
vices. Alongside the entrepreneurs who buy land services, labor, and 
capital good services as productive services, are also found, on the 
market for services, landowners, workers, and capitalists who buy 
land service, labor, and capital good services as consumable services. 
We will introduce them at an appropriate time; for the moment, we 
must concentrate on the study of the purchase of services as pro-
ductive services. hese productive services are exchanged in accord-
ance with the mechanism of free competition with the intervention 
of a numeraire (§ 42). For each of them a price is cried in terms of 
the numeraire; if, at the price cried in that way, the efective demand 
exceeds the efective supply, the entrepreneurs bid against one 
another and the price rises; if the efective supply exceeds the efect-
ive demand, the landowners, workers, and capitalists underbid one 
another, and the price falls. he current price is the one for which 
efective supply and demand are equal.
he current contract price of land services in numeraire, deter-
mined in the manner discussed, we will call rent.


208 heory of production

he current contract price of labor in numeraire, determined in 
advance in the manner discussed, will be called wages.
he current price of capital good services in numeraire, will be 
called interest.
hat is how, thanks to the distinction between capital and income, 
and to the deinition of the entrepreneur, we immediately identify 
productive services, a market for these services, efective supply and 
demand, and inally, as a result of supply and demand, a current price. 
We will see later on, the fruitless eforts made by French or English 
economists to determine rent, wages, and interest; that is to say, the 
price of productive services, without markets for these services.
182. he other market is the market for products. here the entre-
preneurs gather as sellers, and the landowners, workers, and capi-
talists as buyers of products. hese products are also exchanged in 
accordance with the mechanism of free competition with the aid of 
a numeraire. For each of them a price is cried in terms of the numer-
aire; if, at the price cried in this way, the efective demand exceeds 
the efective supply, the landowners, workers, and capitalists will bid 
against one another and the price rises; if the efective supply exceeds 
the efective demand, the entrepreneurs will underbid each other, 
and the price falls. he current price is the one at which the efective 
demand and supply are equal.
hat is how we identify, in this connection, a market, supply and 
demand, and a current price of products.
183. hese concepts, it should be noted attentively, are in exact con-
formity with the facts, with observation, with experience. In fact, 
thanks to the intervention of money, the two markets, one for ser-
vices and the other for products, are perfectly distinct in the real 
world just as they are in regard to science. And, on each of them, sales 
and purchases take place in accordance with the mechanism of rais-
ing and lowering the price. Go to a shoemaker to buy a pair of shoes; 
it is the entrepreneur that hands over the product and who receives 
the money: the transaction takes place on the market for products. 
If more of the products are demanded than supplied, another con-
sumer will outbid you; if more products are supplied than demanded, 
another producer will underbid your shoemaker. on one side of you, 


Elements and mechanism of production 209

a worker sets his price for making a pair of shoes; it is the entrepre-
neur who obtains the productive service and who pays the money: 
the transaction takes place on the market for services. If more labor is 
demanded than supplied, another entrepreneur will outbid the shoe-
maker; and if more is supplied than demanded, another workman 
will ofer his services at a lower price. Although these two markets 
are distinct, they are, nevertheless, closely related to each other; for 
it is with the money that they have received for their productive ser-
vices on the irst market that the landowners, workers, and capitalists 
go as consumers to the second market to buy products; and it is with 
the money they have received for their products in the second one 
that the entrepreneurs go as producers to the irst market to buy pro-
ductive services.
184. he state of equilibrium in production, implicitly containing the 
state of equilibrium in exchange, is now easy to deine. First, it is the 
one in which the efective supply and demand for productive services 
are equal, in which there is a stationary current price in the market 
for these services. Second, it is the one in which the efective supply 
and demand for products are equal, and in which there is a stationary 
current price in the products market. Finally, it is the one in which 
the price of products is equal to the average cost of the productive 
services that are used. he two irst conditions relate speciically to 
the equilibrium in exchange; the third is speciic to the equilibrium 
of production.
hat state of equilibrium in production is, like the state of equilib-
rium in exchange, an ideal and not a real state. It never happens in 
the real world that the prices of products are absolutely equal to the 
average cost of the productive services that enter into them, no more 
than it ever happens that the efective supply and demand of product-
ive services or of products are absolutely equal. But it is the normal 
state in the sense that it is the one towards which things spontan-
eously tend in a regime of free competition in production as well as 
in exchange. In this regime, in fact, if the price of a product exceeds 
the average cost in certain irms, which constitutes a proit, entrepre-
neurs low towards this branch of production or increase their out-
put, which increases the quantity of the product; they lower the price, 
and reduce the excess; and, if, in certain enterprises, the average cost 


210 heory of production

exceeds the price, which constitutes a loss, entrepreneurs leave this 
branch of production or decrease their output, which decreases 
the quantity of products; in fact they raise the price and once again 
reduce the diference. Let us note in passing that we ind here, in the 
desire to avoid losses and to make proits, the determining reason 
for the demand for productive services and the supply of products 
by the entrepreneurs, just as we have already found, in the desire to 
obtain the maximum satisfaction of wants, the determining reason 
for the supply of productive services and the demand for products by 
the landowners, workers, and capitalists. Let us add that in the state 
of equilibrium of exchange and of production, we can, as we have 
observed (§ 175), make abstraction if not from the numeraire at least 
from money, the landowners, workers, and capitalists receiving and 
the entrepreneurs giving a certain quantity of products under the 
name of rent, wages, and interest in exchange for a certain quantity 
of productive services under the name of land services, labor, and 
capital good services. We can even, in that state, make abstraction 
from the intervention of the entrepreneur, and consider not only the 
productive services as being exchanged for products and products 
as being exchanged for productive services, but, when all is said and 
done, even consider the productive services as being exchanged for 
each other. Bastiat and his disciples truly said, as we have, that in the 
last analysis services are exchanged for services; but they meant to 
speak only of personal services, whereas for our part, we are speak-
ing of the services of land, persons, and movable capital goods.
hus, in the state of equilibrium in production, the entrepreneurs 
make neither proit nor loss. hey make their living not as entre-
preneurs, but as landowners, workers, or capitalists in their own 
irms or in others. In my opinion, to have rational bookkeeping, an 
entrepreneur who owns the land that he cultivates or occupies, who 
participates in the management of his irm, who has his own funds 
invested in the business, ought to charge his business with his general 
expenses and credit it with the rent, wages, and interest calculated at 
the market rate for productive services, by means of which he earns 
a living, without his making, as an entrepreneur, either proit or loss. 
And, in fact, is it not evident that if he gets for his productive ser-
vices, in his own business, a higher or lower price than he can get 
elsewhere, the diference is a proit or a loss?

185. he entrepreneur is therefore the person (an individual or a 
corporate entity) who buys raw materials from other entrepreneurs, 
then obtains land from landowners by payment of a rent, hires the 
personal faculties of workers by payment of wages, borrows capital 
from capitalists by payment of interest, and, inally, having applied 
certain productive services to the raw materials, sells the resulting 
products for his own account. he agricultural entrepreneur buys 
seed, fertilizers, and unfattened livestock; he rents land, farm build-
ings, farm implements, hires workers, harvesters, farm hands; and he 
sells agricultural crops and fattened livestock. he industrial entre-
preneur buys textile ibers, crude metals; he rents factories, work-
shops, machines, tools; employs spinners, metal workers, mechanics; 


212 heory of production

and he sells his made products: fabrics, metallic goods. he commer-
cial entrepreneur buys merchandise wholesale; he rents warehouses, 
shops, employs clerks, traveling salesmen; and he sells his goods at 
retail. When these entrepreneurs sell their products or merchandise 
at a price higher than the cost of the raw materials, rent, wages, and 
interest, they make a proit; in the contrary case, they incur a loss. hat 
is the alternative that characterizes the role of the entrepreneur.
186. Taken together with our table of elements of production (§ 174), 
that deinition explains the table and justiies it.
he capital goods classiied under the irst, second, and third head-
ings, which are the capital goods that yield consumable services, are 
those found in the hands of landowners, workers, or capitalists, in 
their capacity as consumers. he capital goods classiied under the 
fourth, ith, and sixth headings, that is, the capital goods that yield 
productive services, are those found in the hands of entrepreneurs. 
hus, it is always possible to tell whether a service is a consumable 
service or a productive service. For example, the land services of pub-
lic parks, the work of public oicials, and the capital good services of 
public ediices are not productive services but consumable services, 
because the State is not an entrepreneur trying to sell products at a 
price at least equal to their average cost, but a consumer that is sub-
stituted, through taxation, for landowners, workers, and capitalists, 
and that buys services and products in their place.
Similarly, among income commodities, those classiied under the 
eighth heading are in the hands of consumers; and those classiied 
under the ninth heading are in the hands of entrepreneurs. But this 
is the place for a very important observation.
Landed capital and personal capital are hired in kind. he land-
owner rents out his land and the worker hires out his personal facul-
ties for a year, for a month, for a day, and they regain them at the end 
of the contracted period. Movable capital goods, apart from build-
ings and a few kinds of furnishings or tools, are hired out not in kind, 
but in money. he capitalist accumulates his capital by successive 
savings and lends money to the entrepreneur for a given period; the 
entrepreneur converts this money into capital goods properly speak-
ing and, at the expiration of the contract, he returns the money to 
the capitalist. hat operation constitutes credit. he result is that the 


he entrepreneur. Business accounting and inventory 213

income goods consisting of raw materials, classiied under the ninth 
heading, and the movable capital goods classiied under the sixth 
heading, can be part of the capital borrowed by the entrepreneur. 
he name ixed capital or expenses of ixed assets is given to movable 
capital goods; it is the ensemble of all those things that are used more 
than once in production. he name circulating or working capital is 
used to designate raw materials along with the capital goods classi-
ied under the seventh heading and the new income goods classiied 
under the tenth heading; it is the ensemble of all those things that are 
not used more than once in production.
he circulating money classiied under the eleventh heading is in 
the hands of consumers; money classiied under the twelth heading 
forms part of the circulating capital of entrepreneurs. he savings 
classiied under the thirteenth heading is in the hands of consumers 
and represents exactly the excess of income over consumption.
187. he proit or loss position of an entrepreneur results at any 
moment from the situation in his books and the state of his raw mate-
rials and products in inventory. Hence this is the time to explain the 
business methods of accounting and inventorying. hese methods, 
derived from ordinary practice, will be found completely in accord 
with the preceding conceptions, proving that our theory of produc-
tion is well-founded on the nature of things. I shall irst explain in a 
few words the principles of double entry bookkeeping.
188. As an entrepreneur I have, irst, a till into which I put money 
when I receive it, and from which I take cash when I need it for my 
expenses. here is thus, coming from the outside into the till and 
going from the till to the outside, a double low of money: a low of 
money received and a low of money paid out. It is clear, moreover, 
that the quantity of money in my till at any given moment is always 
equal to the diference between the quantity of money put in and 
the quantity of money paid out, neither more nor less. As a general 
rule, there is never found in the till any money other than that which 
has been put there minus that which has been taken out. hat being 
stated, if I take a blank page in an account book and head it Cash; if 
I enter, in a column on one side of the page, on the let, for example, 
the various amounts that I have successively put into my till; if I enter 


214 heory of production

in a similar column on the other side of the page, the right side in 
this case, the amounts that I have successively taken out, then the 
diference between the total on the let and the total on the right must 
always represent exactly the total amount of cash in the till. hese 
two totals may be equal, or their diference zero, as happens when the 
till is empty; but the right-hand total can never be greater than the 
let. he two columns taken together make up what is called the Cash 
account; the total on the let is usually called the debit, while that on 
the right is called the credit balance of the Cash account; the dife-
rence between the two, positive or zero but never negative, is called 
the balance of the Cash account.
189. Up to this point we see nothing resembling double entry book-
keeping; but we will now see its nature.
he money that enters my till comes from capitalists who have 
lent it to me or from consumers who have bought products from 
me, and the money that leaves my till will be transformed either into 
ixed capital or working capital. Now, I am assuming that whenever 
I enter on the debit side of my Cash account an amount put into my 
till, I always wish to record where it comes from, and that, similarly, 
when I enter on the credit side of my Cash account an amount taken 
out of my till, I always wish to record where it is going. Let us see 
how I do this. For instance, the irst money that I am going to put 
into my till is a sum lent to me by my friend named Martin to whom 
I promise repayment in installments over a period of two or three 
years. How shall I indicate that this sum comes from Martin? Very 
simply. Ater the entry to the debit of Cash, I write these words: To 
Capitalist or To Martin. But if I am going to do this properly, I cannot 
stop there. I take another blank page in my account book and I write 
at the top: Capitalist or Martin; and then, immediately ater entering 
the amount on the debit side of the page of the Cash account, that is, 
on the let side of the page, I write the same amount on the credit or 
right side of the page of Capitalist’s or Martin’s account; and, imme-
diately before the notation of this sum to the credit of the Capitalist 
or Martin account, I write these words: By Cash. hat much, then, 
is done. one can guess that there is another step that is now to be 
taken, namely the one to be taken when, in the contrary case, instead 
of putting money into the till, I take it out to pay an installment on 


he entrepreneur. Business accounting and inventory 215

what I owe to my capitalist Martin. I enter this sum to the credit of 
my Cash account with the notation: By Capitalist or By Martin, and 
at the same time I debit it to Martin’s account with the notation: To 
Cash. Consequently, just as the debit balance of the Cash account at all 
times furnishes information concerning the cash I have on hand, so 
also the credit balance of Martin’s account always keeps me informed 
on another matter that I must constantly keep in mind, namely that 
of knowing the amount of money I still owe to my capitalist Martin.
It is the same for the other sums that I withdraw from or put into 
my till. If, for example, I take out cash in order to install a machine 
in my workshop, since that machine is part of what we have called 
ixed capital, the amount of which I must be in a position to ascer-
tain rapidly at all times, I open an account: Fixed Assets, and I then 
enter the sum withdrawn to the credit of Cash with the notation: By 
Fixed Assets, and to the debit of Fixed Assets with the notation: To 
Cash. I deal in the same way with items of working capital. If I take 
money to buy raw materials or merchandise wholesale, or to pay my 
rent or my workers, that is, generally speaking, to pay rent, wages, 
and interest, I will enter it to the credit of Cash and to the debit of 
Working Capital. And if I put into my till the money earned from 
the sale of my products, I will enter the sum to the debit of the Cash 
account and to the credit of the Working Capital account. In current 
accounting practice, the Working Capital account is replaced by two 
others: a Merchandise account that is charged with raw materials and 
merchandise purchased wholesale, and a General Expenses account 
that is charged with rent, wages, and interest. We can, if we ind it of 
interest, make this subdivision or any other in even greater detail; 
but, as we will shortly see, all these special accounts, by which the 
general Working Capital account will be replaced, must be reunited 
when the inventory is made.
hat is double entry bookkeeping, the cardinal principle of which 
is never to enter a sum to the debit or credit of an account without sim-
ultaneously entering the amount to the credit or debit of some other 
account; from which it follows that the total of the debit balances or 
assets is always equal to the total of the credit balances or liabilities. 
he book that contains entries made in the order of accounts, and 
secondarily in the order of dates, is called the Ledger. It is accom-
panied by another record containing the same entries in the order of 


216 heory of production

their dates, and secondarily in the order of accounts, known as the 
Journal.
190. A Cash account, that is sometimes debited and sometimes cred-
ited; a Capitalist liability account that may be divided into as many 
sub-accounts as there are capitalists that lend money; a Fixed Assets 
account that is generally debited; a Working Capital account that 
is sometimes debited and sometimes credited: those are the four 
accounts essential for any enterprise. he debit side of the Fixed 
Assets account represents the total money value of the ixed capital, 
and the debit side of the Working Capital account represents the 
total money value of the unrealized circulating capital. A question 
much discussed these days is whether the double entry bookkeeping 
that we have described above is or is not as suitable for use in agri-
culture as it is in industry, commerce, and banking. hat amounts 
to asking whether or not agriculture is an industry that consists in 
applying land services, labor, and capital good services to raw mate-
rials in order to obtain products. If so, and that most certainly is the 
case, then unquestionably double entry bookkeeping can be used in 
agricultural enterprises just as well as in industrial, commercial, and 
inancial enterprises, and if people have not yet succeeded in so using 
it, that is only because they do not know how to create the various 
accounts on a rational basis. We have here a striking example of the 
way in which theory and practice ought to be of help to one another; 
for it is certain that industrial practice, expressed through account-
ing, can successfully serve to establish the theory of production, and 
it is equally certain that that theory, once established, can serve no 
less felicitously to express agricultural practice through accounting.
191. We now have to expound the method of making business inven-
tories and how an entrepreneur’s proit or loss position is established. 
he best way of doing this will be to take an example that conforms 
to the usages and terminology of current accounting.
I am now an entrepreneur in the business of cabinet making. I 
started with 3,000 francs that I saved and 7,000 francs lent to me by 
relatives and friends who were interested in me and had conidence 
in me. hese persons and I signed a private agreement in accordance 
with which they committed themselves to lend me their 7,000 francs 


he entrepreneur. Business accounting and inventory 217

for ten years, and I pledged to pay them 5 per cent annual interest. 
hey thus became my silent partners, while I am my own silent part-
ner and ought to pay myself 5 per cent interest on my 3,000 francs. 
When I put the 10,000 francs into my till, I debited that amount to 
my Cash account and credited 10,000 francs to my Capitalist account. 
If the silent partners did not pay the whole sum to me immediately, 
or if they did not all pay at the same time, I would have had to open 
separate accounts A, B, C, etc.
Having done this, I rented a plot of ground for 500 francs a year, 
on which I had a workshop built that I equipped with machines, 
work-benches, and lathes. hat cost me 5,000 francs that I paid in 
cash. Upon withdrawing the 5,000 francs from my till, I credited the 
Cash account 5,000 francs and debited my Fixed Assets account 5,000 
francs.
hen I bought lumber, cloth, etc., for 2,000 francs; and, in conse-
quence, I credited this amount to the Cash account, and debited the 
Merchandise account 2,000 francs.
In addition, I paid out 500 francs for interest on the capital that 
I invested, 500 francs for the rent of my land, and 2,000 francs for 
wages. I credited the Cash account 3,000 francs and debited the 
General Expenses account 3,000 francs.
But, all these expenses having been made, I had pieces of car-
pentry and furniture that clients had ordered and that I delivered. 
I sold them for 6,000 francs cash; and, in putting the 6,000 francs 
into my till, I debited the Cash account 6,000 francs and credited the 
Merchandise account 6,000 francs.
192. At this point in time, I make my inventory. And, in order to 
simplify as much as possible, I assume that I no longer have any mer-
chandise, or raw materials, or products, in stock. I have no more 
merchandise, and nevertheless the Merchandise account is not bal-
anced. It owes the Cash account 2,000 francs, and it has been credited 
6,000 francs from the Cash account. he diference is 4,000 francs. 
From where does this come? he answer is very clear: from my sell-
ing my merchandise for more than I paid for it. In fact, that is what I 
ought to have done: I bought lumber, cloth, raw materials, and I sold 
pieces of carpentry, furniture, and other inely carved products. Now, 
it is clear that, in the price of the inished goods, I must recover not 


218 heory of production

only the price of the raw materials, but also, irst of all, the cost of the 
labor as well as the sum of my overhead expenses, and, secondly, a 
certain proit. hus, that diference of 4,000 francs covers my general 
expenses of 3,000 francs, and leaves me a proit of 1,000 francs. hat 
is why I irst balance the General Expenses account by debiting the 
Merchandise account, and then balance the Merchandise account, 
which must be balanced because there is no longer any merchandise 
in storage, by crediting 1,000 francs to a Proit and Loss account that 
appears among the liabilities. his Proit and Loss account would 
appear among the assets as a debit balance, if I had made a loss.
193. All that being inished, my accounts balance in the 
following way:
he Cash account has received 16,000 francs and has furnished 
10,000 francs. It has a debit balance of 6,000 francs.
he Capitalist account has furnished 10,000 francs. It has a credit 
balance of 10,000 francs.
he Fixed Assets account has received 5,000 francs. It has a debit 
balance of 5,000 francs.
he Merchandise account has received with 6,000 francs and cred-
ited with 6,000 francs. It is balanced.
he General Expenses account has received 3,000 francs and has 
provided 3,000 francs. It is balanced.
he Proit and Loss account has furnished 1,000 francs. It has a 
credit balance, of 1,000 francs.
And, to summarize, my Balance Sheet is as follows:
ASSETS (composed of all accounts with a debit balance)

LIABILITIES (composed of all accounts with a credit balance)

Cash account 6,000 Fr.
Fixed Assets 5,000 Fr.
Total 11,000 Fr.

Capitalist 10,000 Fr.
Proit and Loss 1,000 Fr.
Same total 11,000 Fr.


he entrepreneur. Business accounting and inventory 219

I have earned 1,000 francs, and begin the new accounting period 
with a capital of 11,000 francs instead of 10,000, that is, with 5,000 
francs of ixed capital and 6,000 francs of working capital.
194. We have simpliied as much as possible. But, in practice, there 
are certain complications that must be noted.
(1) he entries are neither found nor made in whole amounts, but 
always piecemeal. It is not all at once but rather in several amounts 
that I paid 5,000 francs for ixed capital, 2,000 francs for merchan-
dise, 3,000 francs for general expenses, and when I sold 6,000 francs 
worth of merchandise.
(2) I do not usually sell for cash, but on credit. And when I sell on 
credit to customers L, M, and N, instead of crediting the Merchandise 
account and debiting the Cash account, I credit Merchandise and 
debit Messrs. L, M, and N; and later, when they pay, I credit the 
accounts of L, M, and N and debit the Cash account. I therefore nor-
mally have a certain number of Customers’ Debtor accounts.
(3) hat is not all. he clients L, M, and N, ater being debtors on 
my books for a certain time, do not usually settle their accounts in 
cash, but either with promissory notes that they make payable to me, 
or with bills of exchange that I draw on them and that they accept. 
And then, when I receive those documents, instead of crediting L, M, 
and N with ofsetting debits to Cash, I credit their accounts by deb-
iting a Bills Receivable account, except that I credit Bills Receivable 
by debiting the Cash account when I receive the payment. I have 
therefore, under normal conditions, a Bills Receivable account (or 
Portfolio account) with a debit balance. his account is analogous to 
the Cash account, inasmuch as the diference between the debit and 
the credit sides always corresponds exactly to the total of the notes 
and bills of exchange in my portfolio.
(4) here is still more. Generally, I do not take possession of my 
bills, but I negotiate them with a banker who discounts them before 
maturity. And when I negotiate bills in this way, instead of crediting 
Bills Receivable by debiting Cash, I credit Bills Receivable by debiting 
my Bank account, except that I credit my Bank account by debiting 
my Cash account when my banker remits the funds. he discount, 
which is interest, is naturally entered as a debit to General Expenses.


220 heory of production

(5) I do not generally buy for cash, but on credit. And when 
I buy on credit from suppliers X, y, and Z, instead of debiting the 
Merchandise account by crediting Cash, I debit Merchandise by 
crediting the accounts of X, y, and Z, except that I debit X, y, and 
Z by crediting the Cash account when I pay them. I have, therefore, 
normally, a certain number of Suppliers’ Creditor accounts.
(6) Here again, ater having sums credited on the books for a cer-
tain time period, I generally do not settle up with my suppliers X, y, 
and Z in cash, but with promissory notes that I make payable to them 
or with bills of exchange that they draw on me and that I accept. And 
then, when I deliver these documents to my creditors, instead of deb-
iting X, y, and Z by crediting Cash, I debit them by crediting a Bills 
Payable account, except that I debit Bills Payable by crediting Cash 
when I pay these notes and bills. hus, I also have, normally, a credit 
account under Bills Payable.
(7) Finally, it never happens that I do not have suicient mer-
chandise, be it raw materials or products, in stock at the time of the 
inventory. hat would create, at the end of each accounting period, a 
totally unfortunate and pointless interruption of operations. on the 
contrary, as I sell furniture, I constantly purchase lumber, cloth. his 
is the merchandise of which I make an inventory. I always balance 
General Expenses by debiting to Merchandise; but instead of balan-
cing the Merchandise account, I simply balance it by using the Proit 
and Loss account in such a way as to leave the Merchandise account 
with a debit balance exactly equal to the inventoried merchandise. 
Here is how that is done. Md and Mc being the debit and credit of the 
Merchandise account; F the debit balance of the General Expenses 
account, I the money value of the Inventory, it is necessary that I add, 
in the case of there being a proit, to Md + F on the debit side of my 
Merchandise account, a sum P such that
(Md + F + P) − Mc = I,
the Merchandise account remaining with a debit balance of I, and 
the Proit and Loss account having a credit balance of P; or that, in 
case of a loss, I add to Mc of the Merchandise account an amount P 
such that


he entrepreneur. Business accounting and inventory 221
(Md + F) − (Mc + P) = I,
the Merchandise account always having a debit balance of I, and the 
Proit and Loss account then having a debit balance of P. hese two 
sums are given by the single equation
Md + F − I ± P = Mc ,
which may be directly deduced from the consideration that the sum of 
the expenditures on raw materials, plus the general expenses paid, minus 
the unused raw materials and the products in stock, plus or minus the 
proit or loss, is equal to the sum realized from the sale of products.
In accordance with this, to make up the Assets statement, the 
Customers’ Debtor accounts, the Bills Receivable, the Bank account, 
and the Merchandise Inventory are added to Cash and to Fixed Assets; 
and, to make up the Liabilities statement, the Suppliers’ Creditor 
accounts and the Bills Payable account are added to the Capitalist 
account and the Proit and Loss account. With these additions, we 
have the ordinary balance sheet of an industrial enterprise. Balance 
sheets of agricultural, commercial, and inancial enterprises would 
be completely analogous.
195. We have seen how, in principle, an entrepreneur can ind out 
at any moment by means of an inventory whether he is making a 
proit or a loss. our deinitions being established theoretically and in 
reference to practice, we are now going to assume that our entrepre-
neurs make neither proit nor loss; we are going, as we said (§ 179), to 
abstract from the entrepreneurs’ working capital in the form of raw 
materials, new capital goods, new income goods, and cash on hand, 
as well as from the consumers’ working capital in the form of accu-
mulations of income goods, circulating money, and savings; and we 
are going to show how the current prices of products and of services 
are mathematically determined in a state of equilibrium.

LESSON 20

Equations of production

SUMMARy: – Utility of products and services; quantities in pos-
session. Equation of the equivalence of the quantities of services 
supplied and the quantities of products demanded; equations of 
maximum satisfaction; individual supply equations for services 
and individual demand equations for products. Equations [1] of 
total supply of services. Equations [2] of total demand for prod-
ucts. Equations [3] of equality of supply of and demand for ser-
vices. Equations [4] of equality of the price and the average cost 
of the products. Constancy of the production coeicients. Raw 
materials.
196. Let us therefore now go back to the services classiied under the 
irst six headings (§ 174) that will remain, ater all the simpliications 
we have pointed out, the essential data of the problem; and let these 
services of land be of the kinds (T), (T′), (T″), , of labor of persons 
of the kinds (P), (P′), (P″), and of capital goods of the kinds (K), (K′), 
(K″), . We assume that these services are valued by means of the 
following two metrics: 1° the natural or artiicial quantity of the cap-
ital good, the hectare of land, the person, and the capital good itself, 
and 2° the unit of time, the day, for instance. So, we will have certain 
quantities of days of land services from a hectare of this or that land, 
certain quantities of days from this or that person, certain quantities 
of days of services from this or that capital good. Let the number of 
these services be n.
By means of the services thusly deined, we can manufacture 
products of the kinds (A), (B), (C), (D), . his production can take 
place either directly, or with a prior production of raw materials; that 


Equations of production 223

is to say, either by combining some land services, labor, and capital 
goods services, or by applying land services, labor and capital goods 
services to raw materials; but we will see that the second case can 
be reduced to the irst one. Let the number of products that can be 
produced in this way be m.
197. For every individual, the products have a utility that we may 
express by a utility function of the form r = ϕ(q) (§ 75). he services 
themselves, however, have a direct utility for each individual. And 
not only can a person, as he wishes, either rent out, or keep for him-
self the whole or a part of the services of his land, his personal fac-
ulties, and his capital goods properly speaking, but, if he wishes to 
do so, may, moreover, purchase land services, labor, or capital good 
services not as an entrepreneur to transform them into products, but 
as a consumer to use them directly; that is to say, not as productive 
services but as consumable services. We have accounted for this by 
placing in a separate category, distinguished from the services classi-
ied under the headings 4, 5 and 6, those that are classiied under the 
three irst headings (§ 174). he services are therefore also commod-
ities whose utility for each individual can be expressed by a utility or 
want equation of the form r = ϕ(q).
Having said this, let an individual be in the possession of qt of (T), 
qp of (P), qk of (K), . And let r = ϕt (q), r = ϕp (q), r = ϕk (q), , 
r = ϕa (q), r = ϕb (q), r = ϕc (q), r = ϕd (q),  be the utility or want 
equations for this individual. Let pt, pp, pk, , pb, pc, pd,  be the 
current prices of the services and the products, measured in (A). Let  
ot, op, ok,  be the quantities efectively supplied of the services at 
these prices, which may be positive and therefore representing quan-
tities supplied, but which also may be negative and therefore rep-
resenting quantities demanded. Let, inally, da, db, dc, dd,  be the 
quantities efectively demanded of the products at these same equi-
librium prices. Abstracting, till the following part [Part V], from 
depreciation of existing capital goods and their insurance, as well as 
from the creation of savings with a view to the creation of new capital 
goods properly speaking, we have irst between these quantities and 
prices the equation


224 heory of production
ot pt + op pp + ok pk += da + db pb + dc pc + dd pd +
Because of the condition of maximum satisfaction (§ 80) that deter-
mines obviously the positive or negative supply of services and the 
demand for products, we have, moreover, between these same prices 
and these same quantities, the equations
ϕt (qt − ot ) = pt ϕa (da ),
ϕp (qp − oP ) = ppϕa (da ),
ϕk (qk − ok ) = pkϕa (da ),



ϕb (db ) = pbϕa (da ),
ϕc (dc ) = pcϕa (da ),
ϕd (dd ) = pd ϕa (da ),


hence n + m – 1 equations that form with the preceding one a system 
of n + m equations of which one can eliminate successively n + m – 
1 of the unknowns ot, op, ok, , da, db, dc, dd,  such that there will 
only remain one equation yielding the n + mth one as function of the 
prices pt, pp, pk, , pb, pc, pd, . We would then have the following 
equations of supply of or demand for (T), (P), (K), 
ot = ft (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),
op = fp (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),
ok = fk (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),




Equations of production 225
and the following equations of demand for (B), (C), (D), 
db = fb (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),
dc = fc (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),
dd = fd (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),


he demand for (A) would be given by the equation
da = ot pt + op pp + ok pk +− (db pb + dc pc + dd pd +).
198. Likewise, we would have the individual demand or supply equa-
tions of the services and the individual demand equations of the 
products for all the other possessors of services. Now, denoting by 
Ot, Op, Ok,  the total quantities supplied of the services, namely the 
excesses of the positive ot, op, ok,  over the negative ot, op, ok, , by 
Da, Db, Dc, Dd,  the total quantities demanded of products, and by 
Ft, Fp, Fk, , Fb, Fc, Fd,  the sums of the functions ft, fp, fk, , fb, fc, 
fd, , we would already have, in order to determine the quantities 
we seek, and subject to the reservation that the functions satisfy the 
restrictions relating to the case in which a quantity supplied equals 
the total quantity possessed, like those in the theory of exchange 
([Part III] §§ 118, 119, 120), the following system of n equations of 
total supply of services:
Ot = Ft (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),
Op = Fp (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,), [1]
Ok = Fk (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),


and the following system of m equations of total demand for 
products:


226 heory of production
Db = Fb (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),
Dc = Fc (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),
Dd = Fd (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,), [2]



Da = Ot pt + Op pp + Ok pk +− (Db pb + Dc pc + Dd pd +);
hence, in total m + n equations.
199. Moreover, let, at, ap, ak, , bt, bp, bk, , ct, cp, ck, , dt, dp, dk,  
be the coeicients of production; that is to say, the respective quan-
tities of productive services (T), (P), (K),  that enter into the pro-
duction of one unit of each of the products (A), (B), (C), (D), ; 
we would then have further, for the determination of the quantities 
searched for, the following two systems:
at Da + bt Db + ct Dc + dt Db += Ot ,
apDa + bpDb + cpDc + dpDb += Op , [3]
ak Da + bk Db + ck Dc + dk Db += Ok ,


hence n equations expressing that the quantities of employed product-
ive services are equal to the quantities efectively supplied;
at pt + ap pp + ak pk += 1,
bt pt + bp pp + bk pk += pb ,
ct pt + cp pp + ck pk += pc , [4]
dt pt + dp pp + dk pk += pd ,


hence m equations expressing that the prices of the products are equal 
to their average costs in terms of productive services.


Equations of production 227
200. As can be seen, we assume that the coeicients at, ap, ak, , bt, 
bp, bk, , ct, cp, ck, , dt, dp, dk,  are ixed a priori. In reality that is 
not the case: in the production of a product, more or less product-
ive services can be used; more or less land services, for example, on 
the condition of using less or more other productive services, less 
or more capital good services or labor, for example. he respective 
quantities of the productive services that enter thus into the mak-
ing of a unit of each of the products are determined only ater the 
prices of the productive services are determined, by the condition 
that the average cost of the products be minimized. It would be easy 
to express this condition by a system of as many equations as there 
are production coeicients to be determined. For the time being, we 
abstract from that procedure by assuming that the above coeicients 
are included in the given data and not among the unknowns of the 
problem.
In making this assumption, we are neglecting another circum-
stance, that of the distinction between the ixed expenses and the 
variable expenses in the irms. However, since we are assuming that 
the entrepreneurs do not make proits or losses, we can also assume 
that they manufacture equal quantities of products, in which case all 
the expenses of whatever kind may be considered as proportional.i
201. As we have said above, we will reduce the case of the application 
of productive services to raw materials to the case of combining land 
services, labor, and capital good services with each other. his is how 
we must proceed, because the raw materials themselves are products 
obtained either by the combination of quantities of productive ser-
vices with each other, or by the application of productive services to 
other raw materials of which one could say the same thing, and so 
forth.
A unit of product (B), for example, being obtained by applying the 
quantities βt of (T), βp of (P), βk of (K), , and the quantity βm of the 
raw material (M), the average cost pb of (B) is given by the equation
pb = βt pt + βp pp + βk pk ++ βm pm ,
where pm is the average cost of (M). he raw material (M), however, 
being itself a product of which a unit is obtained by the combination 


228 heory of production
of mt of (T), mp of (P), mk of (K), , has average cost pm given by the 
equation
pm = mt pt + mp pp + mk pk +
Substituting this value of pm in the preceding equation, we obtain
pb = (βt + βmmt )pt + (βp + βmmp ) pm + (βk + βmkmk )pk +
his equation is none other than the second one of system [4] if 
one sets
βt + βmmt = bt , βp + βmmp = bp, βk + βmmk = bk ,.
It is immediately seen what would have to be done if the raw 
material (M) were to be obtained, not by the combination of pro-
ductive services with each other, but by the application of productive 
services to whatever other raw material.
202. hus we have a total of 2m + 2n equations. But these 2m + 2n 
equations can be reduced to 2m + 2n – 1. Indeed, if we multiply the 
two members of the n equations of system [3] by pt, pp, pk, , and 
the two members of the m equations of the system [4] with Da, Db, 
Dc, Dd, , respectively, and if we add separately the equations of 
each system, then we arrive at two total equations of which the irst 
members are identical, and this results in equality of the two second 
members:
Ot pt + Op pp + Ok pk += Da + Db pb + Dc pc + Dd pd +,
which is nothing other than the mth equation of system [2]. Hence we 
can, if we wish so, keep this one and skip, for instance, the irst one of 
system [4], or vice versa. However, there are 2m + 2n – 1 equations 
to determine 2m + 2n – 1 variables in the state of equilibrium, and 
these are: 1. the n total quantities of services supplied, 2. the n prices 
of these quantities, 3. the m total quantities of products demanded, 
and 4. the m – 1 the m – 1 of m – 1 of these products expressed 
in the mth. he only thing we still have to show, as far as concerns 


Equations of production 229

the equilibrium of production just as it concerned that of exchange, 
is that this same problem, whose theoretical solution we have pre-
sented, is also the one that solves itself automatically in the market by 
means of the mechanism of free competition.
203. he problem is to arrive at the equilibrium of production in the 
same way as we arrived at the equilibrium of exchange; that is to say, 
assuming that the data of the problem do not change during the whole 
time of duration of our tatonnements, apart from the assumption 
later that these data will vary with a view to the study of the efects of 
these variations. However, with respect to the tatonnement in mat-
ters of production, a problem arises that did not occur in exchange. 
In exchange, commodities do not undergo quantity changes. When 
a price is cried, and when efective supply and demand at that price 
are not equal, another price is cried which entails other amounts of 
efective supply and demand. In production, productive services are 
transformed into products. If certain prices of services have been 
cried and certain quantities of products made, and if these prices 
and these quantities are not equilibrium prices and quantities, it is 
not only necessary to cry other prices, but also manufacture other 
quantities of products.
Accepting this necessity, we must assume that, for every reprise of 
the tatonnement, our entrepreneurs will ind, in the country, land-
owners, workers, and capitalists who possess the same quantities of 
services and have the same wants for services and products. A reprise 
of the tatonnement will consist of the following. At prices in the irst 
instance cried at random, and then raised or lowered in accordance 
with circumstances, the entrepreneurs borrow from the landowners, 
workers, and capitalists the quantities of services necessary for the 
production of certain quantities of products determined in irst 
instance at random, and then increased or decreased in accordance 
with the circumstances. hen they sell these products in the mar-
ket for products, in accordance with the mechanism of free compe-
tition, to these landowners, workers and capitalists, who are still in 
the possession of the same quantities of servicesii and still have the 
same wants for products and services. he tatonnement will be in-
ished when the entrepreneurs will obtain, in exchange for the prod-
ucts they have made, from the landowners, workers, and capitalists 


230 heory of production

exactly the quantities of land services, labor, and capital good services 
they owe these landowners, workers, and capitalists, and that they 
will have used in making products; with the result that the entrepre-
neurs will be able either to settle their debts and end their activity, or, 
instead, continue indeinitely producing the amounts that, from then 
onwards, satisfy the market, provided that no variations occur in the 
data; that is to say, in the quantities of services possessed and in the 
utilities of the services and products.

Notes
i See Appendix I, irst footnote of § 8. See also the discussion of this section 
in the translators’ introduction.
ii his is because Walras assumed that, in the model of production, the cap-
ital goods are constant in amount during the process of equilibration; they 
are not used up in any degree. hat is how it is possible for the services of 
capital goods controlled by the participants in the model to be the same 
amounts from one reprise of the tatonnement to the next. hat is also part 
of the features of the model of production that make its equilibrium inde-
pendent of the path followed by the variables.

LESSON 21

Solution of the equations of production. 
Law of the determination of the prices of 
products and services

SUMMARy: – Assumption that the entrepreneurs commit them-
selves to return productive services in equivalent quantities. Prices 
of productive services cried at random. Average costs of the prod-
ucts. Random quantities of products made. Prices of the products. 
Proits or losses of the entrepreneurs. Tatonnement with a view to 
equality of price and average cost of the products. Demand for the 
numeraire product. Equality of the average cost of the numeraire 
product to unity is necessary for the equilibrium of production.
Assumption that the entrepreneurs commit themselves to return 
productive services in equal quantities. Efective supply of and 
demand for services. Quantities demanded by the entrepreneurs; 
quantities demanded by the consumers. Variations in demand and 
supply in accordance with variations of the price between zero and 
ininity. Tatonnement with a view to equality to unity of the aver-
age cost of the numeraire product. he law of the determination of 
the equilibrium prices of products and services.
204. Let us, therefore, come to the market, and assume that there 
are n prices of productive services pt′,pp′ ,pk′ , and m quantities 
Ωa ,Ωb ,Ωc ,Ωd , of products to be made, all determined at random. 
In order to have a better grasp on the operations that will follow, we 
split them into two phases by means of the following double hypoth-
esis. First, we assume that the entrepreneurs producing (A), (B), 
(C), (D),  buy productive services (T), (P), (K),  while commit-
ting themselves to return at a later time quantities of these services 
that are not equal, but simply equivalent, and so we determine the 


232 heory of production
quantities Ωa ,Ωb ,Ωc ,Ωd , such that the entrepreneurs make nei-
ther proits nor losses. hen we assume that the entrepreneurs com-
mit themselves to providing later on quantities that not only have 
the same value, but that are equal to the quantities bought, and so we 
determine the quantities pt′, p′p , pk′ ,i such that efective demand for 
and supply of services are equal. We can see quite clearly how this 
procedure abstracts, if not from the numeraire, at least from money.
It may perhaps be useful to make the observation that, with our 
data and under the conditions we have imposed, we are assuming that 
the capital goods properly speaking are rented in kind. Nevertheless, 
we have explained (§ 186) that, in reality, the capital goods are lent in 
money, because the capitalist has formed his capital by means of sav-
ing. However, later on we will consider both the creation of capital 
goods and their lending in the form of money.
205. From the prices pt′, p′p , pk′ , of (T), (P), (K), , randomly 
determined as has already been said, result the average costs 
pa′ ,pb′,pc′ ,pd′ , in accordance with the equations
pa′ = at pt′ + appp′ + ak pk′ +
pb′ = bt pt′ + bppp′ + bk pk′ +
pc′ = c t pt′ + c ppp′ + c k pk′ +
pd′ = dt pt′ + dppp′ + dk pk′ +


It will be noticed that we could have determined, if we wished, 
pt′,pp′ ,pk′ , such that pa′ = 1. We will beneit from this omission at 
the right moment, and we will show later on that the average cost of 
the numeraire commodity automatically tends to be equal to unity 
in a regime of free competition. For the moment, we will reason as 
though the average cost of (A) is greater or less than its price, or 
equal to it.
Moreover, the quantities Ωa ,Ωb ,Ωc ,Ωd , of (A), (B), (C), (D), 
 require quantities ∆t , ∆p , ∆k , of (T), (P), (K),  in accordance 
with the equations


Solution of the equations of production 233
∆t = at Ωa + bt Ωb + ct Ωc + dt Ωd +
∆p = apΩa + bpΩb + cpΩc + dpΩd +
∆k = akΩa + bkΩb + ckΩc + dkΩd +



hen being brought to the market, the quantities Ωa ,Ωb ,Ωc ,Ωd , 
will be sold by the entrepreneurs in accordance with the mechanism 
of free competition. Let us irst consider the selling conditions for the 
products (B), (C), (D), . hen we will consider the conditions for 
the sale of the product (A), which serves as numeraire.
206. he quantities Ωb ,Ωc ,Ωd , of (B), (C), (D),  will be sold at 
prices πb ,πc ,πd , in accordance with the equations
Ωb = Fb (pt′, p′p , pk′,,πb ,πc ,πd ,)
Ωc = Fc (pt′, p′p , pk′,,πb ,πc ,πd ,)
Ωd = Fd (pt′, p′p , pk′,,πb ,πc ,πd ,)


Indeed, since free competition is the market rule, the products 
will be sold in conformance with the triple condition: 1° maximum 
satisfaction of wants, 2° uniformity of prices of both products and 
services, and, 3° general equilibrium (§ 122). Now, the above-men-
tioned system has m – 1 equations with m – 1 unknowns, thus fulill-
ing those three conditions precisely.
Consequently, and because the prices πb ,πc ,πd , are generally 
diferent from the average costs pb′, pc′, pd′ , , the entrepreneurs 
producing (B), (C), (D),  will make proits or losses that can be 
expressed by the diferences
Ωb (πb − pb′ ), Ωc (πc − pc′), Ωd (πd − pd′ ),.


234 heory of production
However, we see immediately that if Ωb ,Ωc ,Ωd , are functions of 
πb ,πc ,πd ,, these latter magnitudes are, by this very fact, functions 
of the former, and that, consequently, by means of appropriate modi-
ications, we will bring the prices of these products into equality with 
their average costs.
207. We do not know the functions Fb, Fc, Fd, , but from the very 
nature of exchange it follows that these functions are increasing or 
decreasing at decreasing or increasing values of, respectively, pb, pc, 
pd, and so on. Hence, if, for example, πb > pb′, then we could decrease 
πb by increasing Ωb; and if, for example, πb < pb′, we could increase πb 
by decreasing Ωb. Likewise, if, πc  pc′, πd  pd′ , , we could decrease 
or increase πc , πd ,  by increasing or decreasing Ωc, Ωd, .
Let Ωb′,Ωc′,Ωd′ , be the quantities to be made of (B), (C), (D),  
and for which
Ωb′ = Fb (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,, pb′,πc ,πd ,)
Ωc′ = Fc (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,,πb , pc′,πd ,)
Ωd′ = Fd (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,,πb ,πc , pd′ ,)

hese quantities are substituted for Ωb ,Ωc ,Ωd , in the taton-
nement and then brought to the market where they will be sold 
in accordance with the mechanism of free competition at prices 
π′b ,π′c ,π′d , in accordance with the equations
Ωb′ = Fb (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,,π′b ,π′c ,π′d ,)
Ωc′ = Fc (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,,π′b ,π′c ,π′d ,)

Solution of the equations of production 235
and what we must explain is that π′b ,π′c ,π′d are closer to equality 
with pb′, pc′, pd′ than were πb ,πc ,πd ,.
208. Under the conditions of the tatonnement that we are carrying 
out at this moment, the prices of the services have been ixed and do 
not change. Each exchanger in the exchange has therefore always the 
same income measured in numeraire
r = qt pt′ + qp p′p + qk pk′ +,
and this income has to be divided between the consumption of 
services and the consumption of products in accordance with the 
equation
q o p q o p q o p d d p

As a consequence of the production of certain quantities of the 
goods (B), (C), (D), , certain prices of them are determined, and 
if the quantity of one of the products, say (B), were to increase or 
decrease,ii the irst thing to do, to establish a new equilibrium, would 
be to increase or to decrease the demand for (B) of all the exchangers 
in such a way as to decrease or increase the raretés by a common and 
identical proportion, and at the same time to decrease or increase the 
price of (B) in the same proportion. his can be called a irst-order 
consequence because it has an important efect on the price of (B). 
Ater this adjustment, equilibrium would have been restored if, for 
each exchanger, the amount spent on the consumption of (B), db pb, 
remained unchanged. However, in all cases, that is, in case of either 
an increase or in case of a decrease of the quantity of (B) produced, 
this amount has undoubtedly increased for certain individuals and 
decreased for others. his means that the former would have to sell a 
part of all their goods, which tends to lower the prices, and the latter 
would have to buy all those goods, which tends to raise the prices. 
his now would be a second-order consequence, being of minor 
importance as far as the prices of (B), (C), (D),  are concerned 
for the following three reasons: 1o the variation in the amount to be 


236 heory of production
spent on the consumption of (B), dbpb, is limited by the fact that the 
two factors db and pb vary in opposite directions; 2° this variation, 
which leads to a sale and a purchase of all goods, would, because of 
this very fact, entail the sale and purchase of only very small amounts 
of each of them; and 3° the efects of the sales and of the purchases 
would counteract each other.
What has just been said about the consequences of the change of 
the quantity made of (B), could be said of the consequences of the 
changes of the quantities made of (C), (D), . Hence, it is certain 
that the change in the quantity made of each product has had a dir-
ect efect on the price of this product, entirely in the same direction, 
whereas the changes in the quantities produced of the other prod-
ucts, assuming that they all act in the same direction, have had only 
indirect efects on the price of the product in question, these efects 
being exercised in one direction by some commodities and in the 
opposite direction for others and ofsetting each other to a certain 
degree. Consequently, the system of new quantities produced and 
of their prices is nearer to equilibrium than its predecessor, and, it is 
necessary only to continue the tatonnement in order to approach the 
equilibrium more and more closely.
In that way, we arrive at the determination of certain quantities 
Db′,Dc′,Dd′ , of (B), (C), (D),  that require quantities Dt′,Dp′,Dk′, 
of (T), (P), (K),  in accordance with the following equations:
Dt′ = at Ωa + bt Db′ + ct Dc′ + dt Dd′ +
D′p = apΩa + bpDb′ + cpDc′ + dpDd′ +
Dk′ = akΩa + bk Db′ + ck Dc′ + dk Dd′ +



and these products are sold at prices pb′, pc′, pd′ , in accordance with 
the equations
Db′ = Fb (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,, pb′, pc′, pd′ ,)
Dc′ = Fc (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,, pb′, pc′, pd′ ,)


Solution of the equations of production 237
Dd′ = Fd (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,, pb′, pc′, pd′ ,)


he entrepreneurs would not make proits or sufer losses on these 
quantities of (B), (C), (D), .
Now, this tatonnement is precisely what takes place automatically 
in the markets for products under the regime of free competition, 
when the entrepreneurs low toward or turn away from irms accord-
ing to whether proits or losses are to be made in them (§ 184).
209. To the prices pb′, pc′, pd′,  equal to the average costs, correspond 
the quantities efectively demanded Db′,Dc′,Dd′ , of (B), (C), (D),  
and the quantities efectively supplied Ot′,O′p ,Ok′ , of (T), (P), (K), , 
in accordance with the equations of total supply
Ot′ = Ft (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,, pb′, pc′, pd′ ,)
O′p = Fp (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,, pb′, pc′, pd′ ,)
Ok′ = Fk (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,, pb′, pc′, pd′ ,)


that form, together with the equations of total demand for prod-
ucts, a system of equations of exchange fulilling these three con-
ditions: maximum satisfaction, uniformity of prices, and general 
equilibrium.
hen, there is also an efective demand for Da′ for (A) determined 
by the equation
Da′ = Ot′pt′ + O′p p′p + Ok′ pk′ +− (Db′ pb′ + Dc′pc′ + Dd′ pd′ +).
What is more, we derive from the two systems of equations, one 
of which expresses the average costs of the products as functions of 
the prices of the production factors (§ 205), and the other the quan-
tities of productive services demanded as functions of the quantities 
produced (§ 208), by multiplying the m equations of the irst system 


238 heory of production
by Ωa ,Db′,Dc′,Dd′ ,, respectively, multiplying the n equations of the 
second one by pt′, p′p , pk′,, respectively, adding the two systems 
thus obtained, and observing that the two second members of the 
two additions are identical, the following equation
Ωa pa′ = Dt′pt′ + D′p p′p + Dk′ pk′ +− (Db′ pb′ + Dc′pc′ + Dd′ pd′ +).
Consequently, we have also
Da′ − Ωa pa′ = (Ot′pt′ − Dt′pt′)+ (O′p p′p − D′p p′p )+ (Ok′ pk′ − Dk′ pk′ )+.
he quantity produced of the good (A) is still only determined 
at random; it should likewise be determined such that the entrepre-
neurs do not make proits or losses. It is obvious, then, that the aver-
age cost of the numeraire must be equal to the price. his is what will 
take place if we had taken care to posit from the beginning
pa′ = at pt′ + ap p′p + ak pk′ +=1.
Without this equation, equilibrium is impossible. Moreover, 
assuming that it is satisied, there will be equilibrium if Da′,Db′,Dc′ 
are determined as above. Indeed, the quantities of services of pro-
duction factors owed to the capitalists by the entrepreneurs and the 
quantities to be received by them in exchange of their products will 
be equivalent, since, pa′ being equal to 1, neither the entrepreneurs 
producing (A) nor those producing (B), (C), (D), , will make prof-
its or losses. So, we have
(Ot′pt′ − Dt′pt′) + (O′p p′p − D′p p′p ) + (Ok′ pk′ − Dk′ pk′ ) += 0,
and, consequently, also
Da′ = Ωa pa′ = Ωa .
Hence, in fact, when the price of the services has been ixed so 
that the average cost of the numeraire good becomes equal to unity, 
it will suice, to obtain the partial equilibrium we are seeking, to 


Solution of the equations of production 239
determine, just as we said, Da′,Db′,Dc′ such the entrepreneurs pro-
ducing (B), (C), (D),  make neither proits nor losses. he quantity 
Da′ demanded of (A) will be quite naturally the quantity Ωa made at 
random. hen, the irst condition will be satisied, namely that the 
entrepreneurs take on the commitment to return the productive ser-
vices in quantities that are not equal but simply equivalent to the 
quantities they have borrowed. In other words, all the equations of 
production will then be satisied, except, however, those of the sys-
tem [1]iii of equations of total supply of services.
210. Nevertheless, like the other systems, this one must be satisied 
as well. In other words, it is not enough that the quantities of pro-
ductive services borrowed and returned be equivalent; they must be 
equal, since these same quantities must be used in the fabrication of 
the products.iv Hence the moment has come to close, as it were, the 
production circle by the introduction of the condition, conforming 
to reality, that the products are exchanged for the same quantities of 
services as those entering into their production.
he condition of equality just mentioned will be satisied if 
we have
Dt′ = Ot′, D′p = O′p , Dk′ = Ok′ ,.
In general, however, we have
Dt′ Ot′, D′p O′p , Dk′ Ok′ ,.
observe, pt′, p′p , pk′ , being essentially positive, that when we have 
made pa′ =1 and Ωa = Da′, if there are certain quantities among 
Dt′ − Ot′,D′p − O′p ,Dk′ − Ok′ , that are positive, the other ones must be 
negative, and conversely.
211. he function Ot′ can be written in the form U − u, where the 
function U represents the sum of the positive ot’s, that is of the quan-
tities efectively supplied of the service (T), and the function u the 
sum of the negative ot’s, that is of the quantities efectively demanded 
of this service, not by the entrepreneurs for the production of (A), 
(B), (C), (D),  but by the consumers as a commodity; that is to say, 


240 heory of production

not as a productive service but as a consumable service. Hence, the 
inequality Dt′ Ot′ can be written in the form
at Da′ + bt Db′ + ct Dc′ + dt Dd′ ++ u U.
Let us assume that Da′ does not vary; that is to say, that the entrepre-
neurs producing (A) always make the same quantities, irrespective of 
the variations of pt′, p′p , pk′ , and, accordingly, of the average cost pa′. 
he variable terms bt Db′, ct Dc′, dt Dd′ , of the irst member of the 
inequality above are decreasing functions of pb , pc , pd , and, con-
sequently, of pt′, since these average costs themselves are increasing 
functions of pt′. he variable term u, too, is a decreasing function of 
pt′, Hence, if pt′ augments from zero to ininity and if p′p, pk′,  do not 
change, Dt′+u will decrease from a certain value onwards to zero.
Regarding the single term U of the second member, it is equal 
to zero if pt is equal to zero and even perhaps for certain positive 
values of pt; this will be the case if the values of the various prod-
ucts in proportion to the value of the service (T) are so high that 
the demand for these products by the owners of this service is zero. 
If the price pt increases, the function U is initially increasing. he 
products will then become less expensive in relation to the price of 
the service (T), and the demand for the products will be greater than 
zero and increase simultaneously with the supply of the service. he 
supply, however, will not increase indeinitely. It passes through at 
least one maximum, which will not be superior to the total quan-
tity Qt possessed; then it will decrease to zero if the price tends to 
ininity, namely if (A), (B), (C), (D),  have become free. Hence, if 
pt increases from zero to ininity, U passes from zero, increases, then 
decreases and will become zero again.
212. Under these conditions, and provided that Dt′+u does not become 
zero before U starts increasing, in which case there will be no solu-
tion, there will be a value of pt, greater or less than pt′ according to 
whether Dt′ + u is greater or less than U , for which the efective sup-
ply of and demand for (T) are equal. Let this price be pt′′; let πb′′, πc′′,  
πd′′,  be the prices, equal to the average costs, of (B), (C), (D), ;v 


Solution of the equations of production 241
and let Ωt′′ be the corresponding supply of (T), equal to its demand. 
hen we have
Ωt′′= Ft (pt′′, p′p , pk′,,πb′′,πc′′,πd′′,).
Ater this operation, the function
O′p = Fp (pt′, p′p , pk′ ,, pb′, pc′, pd′ ,)
has become
Ω′p′ = Fp (pt′′, p′p , pk′,,πb′′,πc′′,πd′′,),
and this supply of the service (P) is greater or less than its demand. 
here is, however, a certain value of pp for which efective supply and 
demand are equal that can be found in the same way as the one used 
to ind pt′′. Let this value be p′p′; let πb′′′, πc′′′, πd′′′,  be the prices, equal 
to the average costs, of (B), (C), (D), ;v and let Ω′p′′ be the corre-
sponding supply of (P), equal to its demand. hen we have
Ω′p′′= Fp (pt′′, p′p′, pk′,,πb′′,′πc′′,′πd′′′,).
Likewise, we obtain
Ωkiv t t p k πbiv πc π

iv

d

= F (p′′, p′′, p′′,, , , iv,),
and so forth.
213. When all these operations have come to an end, we have
Ot′′= Ft ( pt′′, p′p′, pk′′,, pb′′, pc′′, pd′′,),
and it has to be established that this supply Ot′′ is closer to the demand 
Dt′′ than the supply Ot′ was to the demand Dt′. Now, this seems proba-
blevi if one observes that the variation from pt′ to pt′′ that brought sup-
ply and demand to equality had its efect [directly on (T)] just in one 
direction, whereas the changes of p′p, pk′ , into p′p′, pk′′, , which 
disturbed this equality had indirect efects in opposite directions on 


242 heory of production

the demand for (T), and therefore compensated each other up to a 
certain point. he system of the new prices pt′′, p′p′, pk′′, is therefore 
nearer to the equilibrium prices than the system pt′, p′p , pk′ ,, and 
we have only to continue in the same way in order to get closer and 
closer to equilibrium.
Now, this tatonnement occurs naturally in the market for services 
under the regime of free competition, since, under this regime, the 
price of the services is raised when demand is superior to supply, and 
lowered when supply is superior to demand.
214. Assume equilibrium has been obtained. We have then the prod-
uct prices
pa′′= at pt′′+ ap p′p′ + ak pk′′+
pb′′= bt pt′′+ bp p′p′ + bk pk′′+
pc′′= ct pt′′+ cp p′p′ + ck pk′′+
pd′′ = dt pt′′+ dp p′p′ + dk pk′′+


and, on the other hand, we have quantities of productive services 
demanded
Dt′′= at Da′ + bt Db′′+ ct Dc′′+ dt Dd′′+
Dp′′ = apDa′ + bpDb′′+ cpDc′′+ dpDd′′+
Dk′′= ak Da′ + bk Db′′+ ck Dc′′+ dk Dd′′+



where the quantities Db′′,Dc′′,dk Dd′′, satisfy also the equations of 
the demand for the products (B), (C), (D), , and the quantities 
Dt′′= Ot′′, Dp′′ = Op′′, Dk′′= Ok′′, satisfy the equations of the supply of 
services (T), (P), (K), , in which pt′′, p′p′, pk′′,, pb′′, pc′′, pd′′,  are the 
independent variables. From these two systems, we can deduce the 
equation


Solution of the equations of production 243
Da′pa′′= Dt′′pt′′+ Dp′′p′p′ + Dk′′pk′′+− (Db′′pb′′+ Dc′′pc′′+ Dd′′pd′′+).
A quantity Da′′ of (A) is then demanded in accordance with the 
following equation
Da′′= Ot′′pt′′+ Op′′p′p′ + Ok′′pk′′+− (Db′′pb′′+ Dc′′pc′′+ Dd′′pd′′+).
Since Dt′′= Ot′′, Dp′′ = Op′′, Dk′′= Ok′′,, we have therefore
Da′′= Da′pa′′.
By this, we see that all the equations of the problem are satisied 
with the exception of the equation of the average cost of the numer-
aire good, from which would follow the equality of the supply and 
demand, or the equation of the demand for this same numeraire 
good, from which would follow the equality of the price and the aver-
age cost, hence being equal to unity. herefore, if we had by chance 
pa′′= 1, we would have also Da′′= Da′, or if we had by chance Da′′= Da′, 
we would have pa′′= 1. But, generally, ater the change of the prices 
pt′, p′p , pk′ , into pt′′, p′p′, pk′′,, brought about as described above, we 
will have
pa′′1,
and, consequently
Da′′Da′.

215. To inish, still by tatonnement, the solution of the general system 
of the equations of production, we have to determine pt′′, p′p′, pk′′, in 
accordance with the equation
at pt′′′ + ap p′p′′+ ak pk′′′ += pa′′′ = 1,
that is to say, by making pt′′′ pt′′, p′p′′ p′p′, pk′′′ pk′′,  depending on 
whether we have pa′′1.


244 heory of production

Starting from this point, we will irst arrive, during the irst stage, 
in the market for products, at a determination of Da′′′ in accordance 
with the equation
Da′′′ = Ot′′′pt′′′+ Op′′′p′p′′ + Ok′′′pk′′′ +− (Db′′′pb′′′ + Dc′′′pc′′′+ Dd′′′pd′′′ +),
[§ 209] and then, during the second stage, in the market for services, 
at a determination of Daiv in accordance with the equation
Daiv = Da′′′paiv .
It must now be established that paiv is closer to unity than pa′′. his 
will seem probable if one realizes that in the case that, for instance, 
pa′′ was > 1, we would have had pb′′′< pb′′, pc′′′< pc′′ , pd′′′< pd′′ , , and, 
consequently Db′′′> Db′′, Dc′′′> Dc′′, Dc′′′> Dc′′, , which means also 
Da′′′< Da′′. Hence, pa′′′
฀฀= 1, when changing into paiv , has increased 
because of the increase of the demand for (B), (C), (D), , and 
decreased because of the decrease of the demand for (A). In the case 
that pa′′ would have been < 1, pa′′′= 1, when changing into paiv , has 
decreased because of the decrease of the demand for (B), (C), (D), 
 and increased because of the increase of the demand for (A). In 
both cases, these tendencies are opposite, and therefore pa will prob-
ably move less far from unity under the inluence of these tendencies 
than it moved towards unity under the inluence of the decrease or 
the increase of pt , pp, pk , . Furthermore, when we continue in 
the same way, pa will more and more closely approach unity. If we 
assume unity will be obtained with paiv = 1, we also have Daiv = Da′′′, 
and the problem is completely solved.
Now, the tatonnement we just described still takes place under the 
regime of free competition. In fact, when we have
Da′′= Da′pa′′,
the producers of (A) owe Da′pa′′. If they sell the quantity Da′′ of (A) 
demanded at the price 1, they will make a proit Da′ − Da′′= Da′ (1 − pa′′). 
his diference is a proit in the proper sense if pa′′< 1 and Da′ > Da′′. 
But then the producers of (A) will expand their production, which 
will increase pt′′, p′p′, pk′′, and, consequently, pa′′, which will get nearer 


Solution of the equations of production 245
to unity. his diference is a loss if pa′′> 1 and Da′ < Da′′. But then the 
producers of (A) will contract their production, which will lower 
pt′′, p′p′, pk′′, and, consequently, pa′′, which will get nearer to unity. 
observe that the entrepreneurs producing (A) are free to avoid this 
situation by not producing at all when the average cost of the numer-
aire good is superior to its price; that is to say, to unity, which puts 
them in a position of unavoidable loss, and will only resume produc-
tion when the average cost is less than or equal to unity. Whatever 
may be the case, ater all, the entrepreneurs producing (A), just like 
those producing (B), (C), (D), , only have to expand, as they do 
indeed, their production in the case of an excess of the price over the 
average cost, and to restrict their production in the case of an excess 
of the average cost over the price. In the market for services, in the 
irst case, they raise the prices of the services; in the second case, they 
lower them. In both cases, they tend to bring about equilibrium.
216. Combining all the elements of this demonstration, we arrive 
at the following formulation of the law of the determination of the 
equilibrium prices in exchange and production: – If several services 
are given with which several products can be manufactured, and if 
these services are exchanged for their products with a numeraire as 
intermediary, for there to be market equilibrium, or, stationary prices 
in numeraire for all these services and all these products, it is necessary 
and suicient: 1o for each service and each product, efective demand is 
equal to efective supply at these prices; 2o the prices of the products are 
equal to their average costs in terms of the services. When this double 
equality is not fulilled, it is necessary, to arrive at the irst one, to raise 
the prices of the services and products of which the efective demand 
is superior to their efective supply, and to lower the prices of those of 
which the efective supply is superior to the efective demand; and, to 
arrive at the second one, to increase the quantity of the products of 
which the price is superior to their average cost, and to decrease the 
quantities of the products of which the average cost is superior to their 
price.
his is the law of the determination of the equilibrium prices in 
exchange and production; joined, as we shall do below, with the law 
of the variation of the equilibrium prices, properly generalized, we 


246 heory of production

will have the scientiic formulation of the double LAW oF SUPPLy AND 
DEMAND AND oF AVERAGE CoST.

LESSON 22

he principle of free competition. Law of 
the variation of the prices of products and 
services. Price curves

SUMMARy: – Analytical deinition of free competition in 
exchange and production. he fact or the concept of free com-
petition becomes a principle. he demonstration of laisser-faire 
laisser-passer has been lacking. Unacknowledged exceptions: pub-
lic services; natural and necessary monopolies; distribution of 
social wealth. Proportionality of the exchange values of services to 
the raretés. Law of the variation of the equilibrium prices of prod-
ucts and services. Purchase and sales curves of a service. Price 
curve of a product.
217. From the demonstration given in lesson 21, it results that free 
competition in production; that is to say, the freedom of entrepre-
neurs to increase their output in the case of making proits and to 
restrict it in the case of making losses, combined with free compe-
tition in exchange; that is to say, the freedom of landowners, work-
ers, and capitalists and entrepreneurs to buy and to sell services and 
products, by bidding up and lowering prices, is certainly the solution 
in practice of the equations of lesson 20. Now, if we go back to these 
equations and to the conditions on which they are based, we see that
– Production and exchange in a market ruled by free competition is an 
operation through which services can be combined into products of the kinds 
and quantities that give greatest possible satisfaction of wants within the lim-
its imposed by the condition that each service as well as each product has only 
a single price in the market.
218. It is now, inally, that the importance of the scientiic treatment of 
economic theory will perhaps be properly acknowledged. Taking this 


248 heory of production

point of view of pure science, we have to accept, and we have accepted 
until now, free competition only as a fact, or even only as a hypothesis; 
for it was of little importance to have recognized it: it was suicient, 
when necessary, to have been able to conceive it. Under these condi-
tions, we study the nature, the causes, and the consequences of free 
competition. As it now happens, these consequences come down to 
obtaining, within certain limits, the maximum of utility. Hence, free 
competition becomes a principle of economic advantageousness, or 
a rule the application of which we only have to pursue meticulously 
in agriculture, industry, and commerce. In this way, the conclusion 
of pure science brings us to the doorway of applied science. observe 
how certain objections to our method automatically vanish here. We 
are told in the irst place: – ‘one of the elements of price determin-
ation under free competition is human freedom, the decisions of 
which cannot be calculated.’ Well, we have never attempted to calcu-
late the decisions of human liberty; we have only attempted to express 
its efects by means of mathematics. In our theory, each exchanger can 
be assumed to establish his utility or want curves as he pleases. hese 
curves once determined, we show how the prices result from them 
under a hypothetical regime of absolute free competition. – ‘Exactly,’ 
they then say to us, ‘absolute free competition is only a hypothesis. In 
reality, free competition is impeded by an ininity of disturbing fac-
tors. It is therefore of no interest whatsoever, except out of curiosity, to 
study free competition in itself without considering these disturbing 
elements, which cannot be represented by any formula.’ he point-
lessness of this objection is obvious. Assuming that there is no fur-
ther progress of science that will allow us to introduce the disturbing 
elements in the equations of production and exchange, which is per-
haps an imprudent assumption and certainly a useless one, does not 
mean that these equations, as we have developed them, do not lead 
us, in spite of everything, to the general and superior rule of freedom 
of exchange and production. hat freedom procures, within certain 
limits, the maximum of utility; the causes that disturb it are there-
fore hindrances to that maximum; and, whatever those causes may 
be, they must be suppressed insofar as is possible.
219. All in all, this is what the economists already said when recom-
mending their laisser faire, laisser passer. Unfortunately, it must be 


he principle of free competition 249

said: until now, the economists did not so much demonstrate their 
laisser faire, laisser aller as maintain it against the socialists, trad-
itional and modern, who, in their turn, advocated state intervention, 
without proving it either. I feel that by expressing myself in this way 
I am going to rule some sensitivities. Nevertheless, I will at least be 
permitted to ask: – How would the economists have demonstrated 
that the results of free competition were good and advantageous if 
they did not know exactly what those results are? And how would 
they have known those results since they have not established the 
deinitions nor formulated the laws that relate to them and that 
establish them? hat is a priori reasoning. Here is some a posteri-
ori reasoning. When a principle is scientiically established, the irst 
thing that can be done, as a consequence, is to detect the cases in 
which it is applicable and those in which it is not. And, vice versa, 
the fact that the economists oten have extended it beyond its true 
range, would undoubtedly be a good proof that the principle of free 
concurrence has not been demonstrated. hus, for example, as far as 
we are concerned, our demonstration of the principle of free compe-
tition is based, irstly, on the appreciation of the utility of the services 
and products by the consumer. It assumes, therefore, that there is a 
fundamental distinction between individual wants, or private utility, 
which the consumer is able to appreciate, and social wants, or public 
utility, which is appreciated in quite another way. Hence the principle 
of free competition, applicable to the production of things of indi-
vidual interest, is not applicable to the production of things of public 
interest. However, are there not economists who fall into this error 
of wanting to submit public services to free competition by putting 
them in the hands of private industry? Another example. our dem-
onstration is based, secondly, on leveling the price and the average 
cost of products. It assumes therefore the possibility of the low of 
entrepreneurs toward enterprises where proits are made and of the 
turning away from enterprises in which entrepreneurs are making 
losses. Hence, the principle of free competition is also not necessarily 
applicable to the production of things that are produced by a natural 
and necessary monopoly. However, are there not economists who 
talk to us every day about free competition in regard to monopo-
lized industries? A inal observation, of the highest importance, to 
close this point. our demonstration of free competition, while giving 


250 heory of production

a prominent place to the question of utility, leaves the question of 
justice completely aside; this is because it restricts itself to showing 
how a certain distribution of products results from a certain distribu-
tion of services, and questions about this latter distribution remain 
unanswered. However, are there not economists who, not satisied 
by exaggerating laisser passer, laisser aller in matters of industry, still 
apply it, completely irrelevantly, to matters of property? hese are the 
dangers of using the verbal method in place of the scientiic method. 
People maintain both what is true and what is false; in this respect, 
there is also no lack of people who deny both what is true and what 
is false. And science stops, perpetually tugged in opposite directions 
by the adversaries, who are, those on one side as well as those on the 
other, both right and wrong.


he land services, labor, and capital good services that are con-
sumed directly can be consumed either in ininitely small quan-
tities measured over time, or in quantities corresponding with units 
of measurement of land, persons, and capital goods proper. here 
may therefore be reason to inscribe in the relevant parts of the above 
scheme underlined quantities of rareté that are more or less between 


he principle of free competition 251

the intensities of the last wants satisied and the irst one not sat-
isied. Furthermore, it is always possible, for services as well as for 
products, that we have to enter in parentheses raretés that are higher 
than the irst want satisied. Subject to these two reservations, the 
proposition [of § 131] can be extended to products and services as 
follows: – Values in exchange are proportional to the raretés.
221. Let (T), (P), and (K) be land services, personal services, and 
capital good services that can be consumed in ininitesimally small 
quantities, and let τr,1τq,1 , τr,2τq,2, τr,3τq,3, πr,1πr,1, πr,2πq,2, πr,3πq,3, 
κr,1κq,1, κr,2κq,2, κr,3κq,3 (Fig. 22) be the continuous utility curves, 
or want curves, of these services for the exchangers (1), (2), (3) in 
the exchange. Let the prices of (T), (P), (K) in (A) be 0.76, 2.16, 
and 1.50.
In the example of our igure, exchanger (1) and exchanger (3) con-
sume all three services: one of the exchangers consumes quantities 
7, 9, and 5 to arrive at raretés 1.50, 4.33, and 3; the other consumes 
quantities 3, 1, and 2, to arrive at raretés 3, 8.66, and 6. As far as con-
cerns exchanger (3), he consumes quantity 1 of land services to arrive 
at rareté 4.50, but he does without labor and capital good services 
because the magnitudes 13 and 9 of his raretés exceed the intensities 
9 and 6 of the irst wants of these services satisied. We therefore have 
the equilibrium scheme:

222. Denoting by Rt ,Rp ,Rk the average raretés of (T), (P), and (K), 
and on condition of taking account of the underlined magnitudes 
and those between parentheses in computing these averages, we 
could put

223. We may also generalize the law of the variation of the prices 
(§ 135), expressing it in the following terms:
– Let several products or services be given and be in a state of equilib-
rium in a market where exchange takes place through the intervention of a 
numeraire, then, all other things remaining unchanged, if the utility of one of 
these products or services increases or decreasesii for one or for several of the 
exchangers, the price of this product or service decreases or increases.
If, all other things remaining unchanged, the quantity possessed by one or 
by several of the exchangers of one of these products or services increases or 
decreases, the price of this product or service decreases or increases.
– Several products or services being given, if the utility and the quantity 
possessed by one of these products or services for one or more exchangers 
change in such a way that the raretés do not change, the price of this product 
or service will not change.

If the utility and the quantity of all the products and services possessed by 
one or several exchangers change in such a way that the ratios of the raretés do 
not change, the prices of these products and services do not change.
To this we may add two other propositions:
– If, all other things remaining unchanged, the quantity of a service pos-
sessed by one or more individuals increases or decreases, the efective supply 
of this product by these individuals increasing or decreasing in the market 
for services, and, consequently, the price decreasing or increasing, the price 
of the products in the production of which this service is used, decreases or 
increases.
If, all other things remaining unchanged, the utility of a product to one 
or more of the consumers increases or decreases, efective demand of these 
consumers for this product increasing or decreasing in the market for the 
products, and, consequently, the price increasing or decreasing, the price of 
the services used in making this product increases or decreases.
224. In lesson 15, we introduced (§ 149) the purchase curves and the 
sales curves; that is to say, the curves of demand in numeraire and 
the curves of supply to acquire numeraire regarding commodities 
assumed to be newly arrived one by one in an exchange market in a 
situation of general equilibrium. hen we transformed the purchase 
curves (§ 151) into price curves by assuming supply equal to the 
quantity possessed. We must come back to this concept to complete 
it for the case of services and products.
225. Let, therefore, (A) be the numeraire. And let, on the one hand, 
the services (P), (K),  and the products (A), (B), (C), (D),  be 
exchanged or ready to be exchanged at prices p′p , pk′ ,, pb′, pc′, pd′ ,, 
determined by general equilibrium, and let, on the other hand, the 
very recently discovered and appropriated service (T) be introduced 
into the market to be incorporated into the mechanism of exchange 
and production.
heoretically, the appearance of (T) would require reestablish-
ing the four systems of equations of production (§§ 198–9) with the 
introduction of two new unknowns pt and Ot, and two additional 
equations, one of the demand for (T):
at Da + bt Db + ct Dc + dt Dd += Ot


254 heory of production

and the other of the supply of (T):
Ot = Ft (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,)
We can reduce these equations to one single equation by designing, 
as we have done in § 211, the sum of the positive ot’s by U and of the 
negative ot’s by u:
at Da + bt Db + ct Dc + dt Dd ++ u = U
However, if we abstract from the changes of the other prices and the 
other efective demands and supplies, and consider them as constants, 
the irst member of this equation is a decreasing function of pt that 
can be represented geometrically by a purchase curve TdTp (Fig. 23), 
and the second member is a function of the same variable pt that is 
successively increasing and decreasing from zero to zero and that 
can be represented by a sales curve MN. he intersection of the two 
curves in T determines the price pt .

226. Let (A) still be the numeraire. And let, on the one hand, the 
services (T), (P), (K),  and the products (A), (C), (D),  be 
exchanged or ready to be exchanged for one another at general equi-
librium prices pt′, p′p , pk′ ,, pc′, pd′ ,, and, on the other hand, let the 
product (B), the production of which has just been discovered and 
brought into the public domain, be introduced into the market to be 
incorporated into the mechanism of exchange and production.
heoretically, the appearance of (B) would require restating the 
systems of equations of production with the introduction of two new 
unknown variables pb and D b, and two additional equations, one of 
the demand for (B):
Db = Fb (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,)
and the other of the average cost of (B):

are led back to the geometrical expression we had already furnished 
[§§ 152–3].

PART IV

THEORY OF CAPITAL FORMATION 
AND CREDIT


259

LESSON 23

Gross and net income. he rate of net 
income. he excess of income over 
consumption

SUMMARy: – he prices of capital depend on the prices of the 
services. Destruction of capital goods by usage, depreciation pre-
mium. Accidental destruction, insurance premium. Gross income 
minus these two premiums is net income. he prices of capital 
goods are proportional to their net incomes. he common ratio of 
the net incomes of the capital goods to their prices is the rate of net 
income. Hypothesis about the production and the supply of new 
productive capital goods. he prices of existing capital goods are 
the same as those of new capital goods, equal to the average cost of 
the latter. he lending of money saving, or credit, and the demand 
for new capital goods by the entrepreneurs.
Land: inconsumable, natural capital goods; their quantities 
are given. Persons, consumable natural capital goods; their 
quantities are also given. Capital goods properly speaking: con-
sumable artiicial capital goods; their quantities are unknowns. 
Equations of the average costs and of the prices of new capital 
goods properly speaking. Income and consumption. Equality, 
positive excess; zero or negative excess. Positive excess equal, less 
than, or greater than the amount of depreciation plus insurance. 
Equations of partial excess. Equations of total excess of income 
over consumption and of the total price of new capital goods 
properly speaking.
227. he existence of landed incomes, personal incomes, and incomes 
from capital goods properly speaking, (T), (T′), (T″), , (P), (P′), 
(P″), , (K), (K′), (K″),  assumes the existence of landed capital, 
personal capital, and capital goods properly speaking each of the 


260 heory of capital formation and credit

same type. We have determined the prices of these incomes, but we 
have not yet determined the prices of the capital goods generating 
the incomes in the form of uses or services. he problem regarding 
this determination is the third great problem of the mathematical 
theory of social wealth: it is the one we are going to tackle in this 
fourth part.
For us, there can be no prices other than market prices. 
Consequently, just as we have considered markets for products 
and services for the determination of the prices of products and 
the prices of services, we must, for the determination of the prices 
of capital goods, consider a market that we will call the market for 
capital goods, in which the capital goods will be bought and sold. 
he products are demanded because of their utility; the services are 
demanded because of their utility and the prices of the products that 
they serve to produce. Why are capital goods demanded? Because 
of their land services, labor, and ‘proits’, but above all because of the 
rent, wages, and interest they yield.i Undoubtedly, one can buy a cap-
ital good with the intention of consuming its services as well as with 
the intention of selling these services, but the latter point of view 
should be considered as the most important one as far as the pur-
chase of capital goods is concerned, for otherwise a person would 
restrict himself to buying the service, that is, to hiring the capital 
good. A person who buys a house to live in himself has to be decom-
posed by us into two individuals, one of whom makes an investment 
of funds and the other of whom consumes directly the service of his 
capital good. We have already discussed the latter individual; now we 
are going to deal with the irst.
228. he prices of the capital goods therefore depend essentially on 
the prices of their services, that is to say, on their incomes. Here, it can 
be seen, we limit the meaning of the word income, making it express 
the price of the service and not the service itself, just as it is the object 
of consumption and the raw material thereof. Moreover, this price 
consists of three completely distinct elements.
First, the diferent existing capital goods do not all wear out by 
usage with the same rapidity. Consequently, while having a given 
income, a more or less expensive capital good will be bought depend-
ing on whether it will be used up less or more quickly.


Gross and net income. he rate of net income 261

Second, diferent capital goods are not equally susceptible to per-
ishing in a sudden and unforeseen manner because of an accident. 
Consequently, while having a given income, a more or less expensive 
capital good will be bought depending on whether it will have less or 
more chance of perishing accidentally.
Indeed, nothing is easier than to take these two circumstances into 
account mathematically.
With respect to the irst element, we only have to assume that the 
amount of its annual income be set apart, proportional to the price of 
the capital good, that is needed either to maintain the capital as it was 
when new, or to replace it when used up. his is called the depreciation 
of capital. he amount to be set apart, the depreciation premium, will 
vary from one capital good to another; but once set apart, all the cap-
ital goods will become rigorously identical with respect to wear and 
tear by usage, since all have been made, in a sense, indestructible.
It is the same with respect to the second circumstance: we only 
have to assume that the amount, proportional to the price of the cap-
ital good, be set apart that is needed to contribute to the reconstitu-
tion of all similar capital goods that yearly perish by accidents. his 
is what is called the insurance of capital. he amount to be set apart, 
the insurance premium, will likewise vary from one capital good to 
another; but once set apart, all the capital goods will become rigor-
ously identical with respect to accidental perishing, since all have 
been made, in a sense, imperishable.
Let P be the price of a capital good. Let p be the price of its service, 
including the depreciation premium and the insurance premium; 
that is the gross income. Let µP be the fraction of this income repre-
senting the depreciation premium, and νP the insurance premium. 
What remains from gross income ater the deduction of these two 
premiums, i.e. π = p − (µ + ν)P, is net income.
229. We can now understand the diference in gross income of capital 
goods of the same value, or, in other words, the diference in value 
of capital goods yielding the same gross income. But it is understood 
as well, no doubt, that the values of the capital goods are rigorously 
proportional to their net incomes. his would at least be the case in a 
certain normal and ideal state that will be the state of equilibrium in 


262 heory of capital formation and credit
the market for capital goods. In this state, the ratio p

P

− (µ + ν)P

, or 
the rate of net income, is the same for all capital goods. Let this ratio 
be i; when we have determined it, we will have determined the price 
of all landed capital, personal capital, and movable capital goods, by 
virtue of the equation
p − (µ + ν)P = iP
or
P p

= i + µ + ν

.

230. We would not have, with only the data we have now at our dis-
posal, the elements of this determination. Until now, we have assumed 
that there are quantities of land, personal faculties and capital prop-
erly speaking that are determined, and that the landowners, work-
ers, and capitalists exchange the services of these capital goods, with 
the exception of the fraction of the services they consume directly. 
Under these conditions, the sale and purchase of capital goods could 
not occur; for the capital goods could only be exchanged against each 
other in proportion to their net incomes, and this operation, that 
theoretically would not have any purpose, would not furnish any 
price in numeraire if the numeraire were not a capital good itself, 
this numeraire being a product or a service having a rareté that can 
be related to the raretés of the other products and services, as it must 
be for the establishment of equilibrium of production to be possible. 
In order to have supply, demand, and prices of capital goods, the 
concept of a stationary economic state must be replaced by that of a 
progressive economic state. We must assume there are entrepreneurs 
who, instead of manufacturing consumer goods, produce new cap-
ital goods. Moreover, we must assume there are landowners, workers, 
and capitalists who, having bought consumable products and ser-
vices for an amount less than the amount of their income, are in the 
position to buy these new capital goods by means of the diference. 


Gross and net income. he rate of net income 263

With these new facts, we have all the elements for the solution of the 
problem, if we remember that the new capital goods are products 
whose prices are subject to the law of costs of production. Indeed, 
in the state of equilibrium, the price of these new capital goods must 
be equal to their average cost; and, on the other hand, the price of 
the already existing capital goods must be equal to the price of the 
new capital goods. So, if we know the average cost of the new capital 
goods, we will know the price of the new or existing capital goods, 
and, consequently, the rate of net income. Here, just as elsewhere, we 
have to express this state of equilibrium mathematically, and we have 
to show how it actualizes itself in the market. Before this, however, 
we must mention an important circumstance whose introduction we 
have postponed (§ 204) until now.
231. In reality, land and personal faculties are only hired in kind; cap-
ital goods properly speaking are generally hired in money in the mar-
ket for services. he capitalist builds up his capital by saving money; 
he lends the money to the entrepreneur, who, at the expiration of the 
loan, repays him the money. his operation is called credit. From this 
it follows that it is the entrepreneurs, producers of products, who 
demand the new capital goods in the markets, and not the capitalists, 
the creators of savings. However, it is evident that, theoretically, it is 
immaterial to the capitalist whether he lends a new or existing capital 
good or the money price of the capital good, and immaterial to the 
entrepreneur which of these alternatives he chooses: it is only from 
the practical point of view that lending money is highly preferable 
to the capitalist. Let us only observe that we should not confuse the 
market for capital goods, which is the market where capital goods 
are bought and sold, with the capital market, where money capital is 
hired, and which is only an annex of the market for services. We will 
meet these two distinct markets in the course of our demonstration. 
Let us also observe that, since we are abstracting from money, from 
now onwards we must speak of numeraire capital, and not of money 
capital.
232. Except in a few cases, that could easily taken into account, but 
with which it is of no use to complicate our formulas, land is a nat-
ural capital good, and not an artiicial, produced good. he price of 


264 heory of capital formation and credit

land has no inluence on its quantity, and its quantity does not react 
on its price. Furthermore, except in a few cases of which we say the 
same as above, land is an indestructible, imperishable capital good: 
there is no need to set apart from its income a depreciation pre-
mium or an insurance premium. From these two observations, it fol-
lows that the quantities of the several types of land are always given 
and are not unknown variables in our problem, and that, regarding 
their prices, they will simply be equal to the quotients of their gross 
incomes divided by the rate of net income, once we have determined 
the latter, in accordance with the equation Pt = p

i

t .

233. Man’s personal faculties are natural capital goods, too. heir 
quantities do not depend on the rise and fall of industrial produc-
tion, but on the luctuations of the population. on the other hand, 
they are destructible, perishable capital goods whose depreciation 
and insurance may be considered as being provided for by reproduc-
tion, and by maintenance, education, and instruction of the wives 
and children of the workers. Hence, the quantities of personal facul-
ties remain given, too, and are not unknown variables in our prob-
lem, and as for their prices, if we want to know them, they will simply 
be equal to the quotients of their net incomes divided by the rate of 
net income, as given by the equation Pp = πp

i

.

234. Capital goods properly speaking are artiicial capital goods; they 
are products; their price is subject to the law of production costs. If 
their price is greater than their average cost, the quantity produced 
will increase and the price will decrease; if their price is less than their 
average cost, the quantity produced will decrease and the price will 
increase. In the state of equilibrium, the price and the average cost are 
equal. So, let there be l types of capital goods (K), (K′), (K″),  and let 
Pk ,Pk′ ,Pk′′ , be their respective prices. If pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,

Furthermore, capital goods properly speaking are destruct-
ible and perishable capital; we must therefore set apart from their 
income a depreciation premium and an insurance premium. Let 
µk Pk ,µk′ Pk′ ,µk′′ Pk′′ ,, νk Pk , νk′ Pk′ , νk′′ Pk′′ , be the fractions to set 
apart from the gross incomes pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,, of the capital goods (K), 
(K′), (K″), . he prices of these capital goods will be equal to the 
quotients of their net incomes divided by the rate of net income, 
hence the quotients of their gross incomes divided by the sum of 
these three rates: the rate of net income, the rate of depreciation, and 
the rate of insurance:

235. Let now an individual possess quantities qt of (T), , 
qp of (P), , qk of (K), , qk′ of (K′), , qk′′ of (K″),  At 
prices pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ , of the services and prices 
Pt ,,Pp ,,Pk ,Pk′ ,Pk′′ , of the capital goods, his income is

and his capital

If this individual cedes quantities, positive or negative, of (T), , 
(P), , (K), (K′), (K″), , equivalent to

In addition, he will consume respective quantities of the products

236. It is possible that our individual demands products (A), (B), (C),

And hence: – he excess of the value of the services supplied over the 
value of the consumable products demanded is also equal to the excess 
of income over consumption.
his excess can be negative; that is to say, that it can turn into an 
excess of consumption over income. We must then assume that our 
individual not only sells all the services he does not consume him-
self, but also a part of his capital goods. his is called ‘consuming his 
capital’. his negative excess can even be greater than the total value 
of the capital goods
qt Pt ++ qpPp ++ qk Pk + qk′ Pk′ + qk′′ Pk′′ +.
In this case, our individual consumes the capital of others as well as 
his own.
237. he deinitions having been made, three cases present themselves:
1° he positive excess is equal to the sum needed for covering 
depreciation and insurance of the capital goods of the types (K), (K′), 
(K″), ; we have then
e = qk Pk (µk + νk ) + qk′ Pk′ (µk′ + νk′ ) ++ qk′′ Pk′′ (µk′′ + νk′′ ) +,
and our person limits himself purely and simply to maintaining the 
quantity of capital goods properly speaking in his possession, with-
out increasing or decreasing them.
2° he excess, positive, zero, or negative, is less than the sum of 
depreciation and insurance; we have then
e < qk Pk (µk + νk ) + qk′ Pk′ (µk′ + νk′ ) ++ qk′′ Pk′′ (µk′′ + νk′′ ) +,
and our person really consumes a part of his capital goods properly 
speaking, which, by lack of provision of depreciation and insurance, 
will no longer, when he uses them in the future, be fully the same 


268 heory of capital formation and credit

amounts he possessed, since they will partly be used up and partly be 
destroyed by accidents.
3° he positive excess is greater than the sum of depreciation and 
insurance; we have then
e > qk Pk (µk + νk ) + qk′ Pk′ (µk′ + νk′ ) ++ qk′′ Pk′′ (µk′′ + νk′′ ) +,
and our person increases the quantities of his capital goods, demand-
ing the production of new capital goods properly speaking instead of 
consumable products. He saves.
Hence: – Savings are the positive diference between the excess of 
income over consumption and the sum of depreciation and insurance 
of the capital goods properly speaking.
Whether the individual in question purely and simply provides for 
the depreciation and insurance of his capital goods properly speak-
ing, or eats into his capital partly or totally, or saves, in each case he 
demands the production of more or less quantities of consumable 
products instead of new capital goods properly speaking, or of new 
capital goods properly speaking instead of consumable products. 
his is why we will consider the positive, zero, or negative excess of 
income over consumption as an element to introduce now into our 
system of equations of production in order to deduce from it the 
system of the equations of capital formation. It will be understood 
that true saving occurs only if the excess is not only positive, but also 
greater than the sum of depreciation plus insurance of existing cap-
ital goods properly speaking.
238. Reasoning as in the case of exchange, we ask, singling out a par-
ticular individual: – on what will the excess of his income over his 
consumption depend? And we answer: – on the prices of the ser-
vices, the prices of the consumable products, and the prices of the 
capital goods. Instead of the prices of the capital goods, we can intro-
duce the rate of net income into our equations, for the sake of sim-
plicity. It is certain that if our individual does not know the prices 
pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,, pb , pc , pd , and i, he cannot arrive at the 
determination of his supply of services, nor his demand for consum-
able products, nor his demand for new capital goods properly speak-
ing. But it is also certain that, once these prices and i are known, he 


Gross and net income. he rate of net income 269

possesses all the necessary elements for this operation, and that, par-
ticularly, his readiness to save can be expressed mathematically in the 
most explicit way by means of an equation of the form:
e = fe ( pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,, pb , pc , pd ,,i),
expressing the excess of income over consumption e as a func-
tion of the prices of the services and consumable products 
pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,, pb , pc , pd , and of the rate of net 
income i.
We posit this savings equation empirically, just as we have pos-
ited, initially, the equation of efective demand. It is perhaps desirable 
to investigate the constituent mathematical elements of the savings 
function, just as we investigated them for the efective demand func-
tion. Evidently it would be necessary for this investigation to con-
sider utility from a new point of view, and to diferentiate present 
utility and future utility. We are not going to undertake this research, 
and we will leave the savings function with its empirical character; 
we do not do so with the pretension in any respect that it is impos-
sible to trace its basic elements, but because that operation does not 
seem to be necessary for the moment. It will be enough for us to 
lay down as a fact that this function is successively increasing and 
decreasing for increasing values of i, because the supply of services 
in exchange for new capital goods does not, any more than does their 
supply in exchange for consumable products, increase indeinitely 
with the quantity of new capital goods desired, but tends to become 
zero again when the price becomes ininitely high; that is to say, when 
one can obtain an extremely high supplement of income with a min-
imal amount of savings.
Let the aggregate of the individual saving functions be indicated by 
Fe, and the sum of the individual excess quantities, from now onwards 
always assumed to be positive, by E; then we have the equation
E = Fe ( pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,, pb , pc , pd ,,i).


270 heory of capital formation and credit
And let Dk ,Dk′ ,Dk′′ , denote the respective quantities produced 
of new capital goods properly speaking (K), (K′), (K″), ; then we 
have the equation:
Dk Pk + Dk′ Pk′ + Dk′′ Pk′′ += E.
239. In this way, we have, inally, 2l + 2 equations for the determin-
ation of the l quantities produced of new capital goods properly 
speaking, the l prices of these capital goods (which are, of course, 
also the prices of capital goods properly speaking that already exist), 
the total excess of income over consumption to be capitalized, and 
the rate of net income, hence just as many equations as unknowns. 
It is evident at irst sight that, ater reducing our 2l + 1 equations to 
l + 1 by the quite easy elimination of Pk′ ,Pk′′ , and E, we have the 
following l equations of equality of the average cost and the price of 
new capital goods:

to determine the rate i of net income. And if we also eliminated i, 
we would have a system of l equations of the distribution of the total 
excess of income over consumption among the l types of capital 
formation, in such a way that shows that the ratio of net income to 
the average cost would be the same for all capital goods, just as we 
would, in the cases of exchange (§ 117) and production (§ 197), have 
respectively systems of n and of n + m equations of the distribution 
of an amount of wealth or income in the possession of an individual 
among his m and n + m types of needs respectively, showing that the 
ratio of the rareté to the price would be the same for all commodities. 
his condition of equality of the ratios of the raretés to the prices of 
the services and the products is the condition for maximum efective 
utility for each exchanger, inasmuch as, if it is not fulilled for any 
two commodities, it is advantageous to demand less of the one with 
the lower ratio and more of the one with the higher ratio. I will show 
later that the condition of the equality of the ratios of the net incomes 
to the prices of the new capital goods is, subject to a particular quali-
ication, the condition for the maximum of efective utility for all 
the exchangers, inasmuch as, if it is not fulilled for any two capital 
goods, it is advantageous to make less of the one for which the ratio is 
smaller and more of the one for which the ratio is greater. In all cases, 
we could carry out, by means of the l + 1 above equations, the deter-
mination of our l + 1 unknown variables, and from these we could 
then deduce the prices of the new capital goods and the total amount 
of savings, subject to sole condition that we abstract from changes 
in the quantities of products to be produced and in the prices of the 
products and services brought about by saving and capital formation. 
However, we want to try to encompass the economic mechanism in 
its entirety; and this is why, in spite of the complication of the nota-
tion (which is, ater all, only an inconvenience that is just as triling 
as it is inevitable), we are going to bring the 2m + 2n +1 equations of 
production and 2l + 2 of capital formation and credit together into a 
single system.

Note
i obviously, when Walras refers to ‘capital goods’ without qualiication in the 
irst part of this section and frequently elsewhere in this lesson he means 


272 heory of capital formation and credit

all three types of capital. In this lesson, he also uses that same term to refer 
to capital goods properly speaking but fails to add the latter two qualify-
ing words. he reader has to pay attention to the context to determine his 
meaning. his poses no diiculty in the cases in which he uses the symbol 
‘K’ and states that it refers to a ‘capital good’ without the qualifying words.

LESSON 24

Equations of capital formation and credit

SUMMARy: – Equation [1] of the total excess of income over con-
sumption. Equations of equivalence between the quantities of ser-
vices supplied and the quantities of products and new capital goods 
demanded; equations of maximum satisfaction; equations of par-
tial supply of services and partial demand for products and new 
capital goods. Equations [2] of total supply of services; Equations 
[3] of total demand for products. Equations [4] of equality of sup-
ply of and demand for services. Equations [5] and [6] of equality 
of the prices and the average costs of products and new capital 
goods. Equation [7] of equality of the total amount of new capital 
goods and the total excess of income over consumption. Equations 
[8] of the prices of new capital goods.
240. First, we have the equation
Fe ( pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,, pb , pc , pd ,,i), [1]
or one equation for the excess of income over consumption.
241. Furthermore, we have for any individual, the equation of 
exchange of services for capital goods, consumable products, and 
consumable services

Moreover, the condition of maximum satisfaction (§ 80), which is 
always the condition determining the positive or negative supply of 
services and the demand for consumable products, yields the fol-
lowing equations between the quantities supplied, the quantities 
demanded, and the prices
ϕt (qt − ot ) = pt ϕa (da )

ϕp (qp − op ) = ppϕa (da )

ϕk (qk − ok ) = pkϕa (da )
ϕk′ (qk′ − ok′ ) = pk′ϕa (da )
ϕk′′ (qk′′ − ok′′ ) = pk′′ϕa (da )

ϕb (db ) = pbϕa (da )
ϕc (dc ) = pcϕa (da )
ϕd (dd ) = pd ϕa (da )

hence n + m – 1 equations that form, with the foregoing one, a system 
of n + m equations by means of which we can obtain, by successive 
eliminations, the n equations of positive or negative supply of (T), ,

244. Now, we have the equation expressing the equality between the 
value of the new capital goods and the total excess of income over 
consumption (§ 234):
Dk Pk + Dk′ Pk′ + Dk′′ Pk′′ += E [7]
that is, an equation of exchange of the total excess of income over con-
sumption exchanged for the newly produced capital goods (§ 238).

246. Recapitulating, we have in total 2n + 2m + 2l + 2 equations. 
But these 2n + 2m + 2l + 2 equations can be reduced to 2n + 2m 
+ 2l + 1. Indeed, multiplying the two members of the n equations 
of system [4] by pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ , respectively, and multi-
plying the two members of the m + n equations of systems [5] and 
[6] by Da ,Db ,Dc ,Dd ,,Dk ,Dk′ ,Dk′′ ,, respectively, and adding the 
equations of each system separately, we obtain two equations whose 
irst members are identical, yielding the following equation between 
the second members

Ot pt ++ Op pp ++ Ok pk + Ok′ pk′ + Ok′′ pk′′ +=

By virtue of the mth equation of system [3], we have

Da + Db pb + Dc pc + Dd pd ++ E.
Consequently, we have also
Dk pk + Dk′ pk′ + Dk′′ pk′′ += E
an equation that is nothing other than equation [7]. We have there-
fore the choice of keeping this one and removing either the mth equa-
tion of system [3] or the irst of system [5], or the reverse. In any 
case, there will remain 2n +2m +2l +1 equations to determine pre-
cisely 2n +2m +2l +1 unknowns, which are: 1°, the n total quantities 
of services supplied; 2° the n prices of these services; 3° the m total 
quantities of the products demanded; 4° the m – 1 prices of m – 1 of 
these products measured in the mth one; 5° the amount of the total 
excess of income over consumption; 6° the l quantities produced of 
new capital goods; 7° the l prices of these capital goods, and, 8° the 
rate of net income. However, we still have to show that this problem 
formulated here theoretically is also the one that is solved practically 
in the market by the mechanism of free competition.
247. It is always a question of arriving at the equilibrium of capital for-
mation in the same way as we arrived at the equilibrium of exchange 
and the equilibrium of production, that is to say, in assuming that the 
data of the problem do not change during the whole time of duration 
of our tatonnements, apart from assuming later that these data are 
variables, in order to study the efects of their variations. Moreover, 
in capital formation, there is a transformation of services into new 
capital goods, just as in production there is a transformation of ser-
vices into products. A certain rate of net income and certain prices 
of the services being cried, and certain quantities of products and 


280 heory of capital formation and credit

new capital goods being produced, if that rate, these prices, and these 
quantities are not the equilibrium rate, prices, and quantities, not 
only must another rate and other prices be cried, but also must other 
quantities of products and new capital goods be produced. Accepting 
this necessity, we must assume that, for each reprise of the tatonne-
ment, our entrepreneur making products or new capital goods will 
ind, somewhere in the country, landowners, workers, and capitalists 
possessing the same quantities of services, having the same needs 
of services and products, and the same preferences for saving. A 
reprise of tatonnement will consist in the following, as far as con-
cerns capital formation envisaged separately. At a rate of net income 
being cried at random initially, and revised subsequently upwards or 
downwards in accordance with circumstances, the entrepreneurs in 
capital goods industries will produce certain quantities of new cap-
ital goods determined initially at random, and revised subsequently 
upwards or downwards in accordance with the circumstances. hen 
they will enter the market for capital goods to sell these new cap-
ital goods in accordance with the mechanism of free competition; 
that is to say, at a price equal to their net income divided by the rate 
of net income (§ 234). he tatonnement will be inished when, at 
the rate of net income cried and with these quantities of new capital 
goods produced, 1° the total amount of the excess of income over 
consumption will be equal to the total amount of new capital goods, 
and 2° the price of new capital goods will be equal to their average 
cost. Production and capital formation will then be able to continue, 
but, of course, with the changes resulting from the existence of the 
new capital goods.

Solution of the equations of capital 
formation and credit. Law of the 
determination of the rate of net income

SUMMARy: – Rate of net income and quantities to be produced 
of new capital goods determined randomly. Prices of the services 
brought about by tatonnement subject to conditions of equality of 
price and average cost of the products and equality of supply and 
demand of the services. Tatonnement in such a way as to result in 
equality of supply and demand of new capital goods. he market 
for numeraire capital. Price of new capital goods equal to the quo-
tients of the gross incomes and the sum of three rates, namely of 
net income, of depreciation, and of insurance; proit or loss for the 
entrepreneurs. How the average costs and the prices of new cap-
ital goods are functions of the quantities produced. Tatonnement 
in such a way as to result in equality of the price and the average 
cost of new capital goods. Law of the establishment of the rate of 
net income.
248. Let us therefore come to the market and assume that a certain 
rate of net income i′ has been determined randomly there, and l 
quantities Dk′,Dk′′ ,Dk′″ , of new capital goods to be produced, plus 
n prices of services, plus m quantities of products to be produced. 
Since we have given the solution of the problem of production, we 
know how we can, by various tatonnements brought into operation 
precisely by the mechanism of free competition, lead the prices of 
the services to the values pt′,, p′p ,, pk′, pk′′ , pk′″ ,, determining m 
values of the average cost of products by means of the equations

expressing the equality of i the m average costs of the productsii and the

ing the n equations expressing equality of supply and demand of the 
services respectively, by pt′,, p′p ,, pk′, pk′′ , pk′′′ ,, adding separately 
the two systems of equations thus obtained, and observing that the 
second member of the irst sum and the irst member of the second 
one are identical, we obtain the following equation:

We have then also

that is to say, that in this state, which we could call a preliminary equi-
librium, the aggregate cost of the product serving as the numeraire 
and that of the new capital goods is necessarily equal to the demand 
for the numeraire plus the excess of income over consumption. hus, 
at this moment, we have satisied the equations of the system [5]

member, although we do not know the function Fe, we know that 
it is a function of i that is successively increasing from zero and

the inequality to equality, we must decrease or increase i′ in accord-

and we must now show that the two members of this inequality 
are closer to being equal than the two members of the preceding 
inequality.
250. Subject to conditions of the present tatonnement, the quantities 
to be produced of the numeraire product (A) and of the new capital 
goods (K), (K′), (K″),  are ixed and do not change. Consequently, 
we always have to reserve for their production the following quantity 
of service (T):
at Ωa + Kt′ = at Ωt + kt Dk′ + kt′Dk′′ + kt′′Dk′′′ +
where Kt′ is the quantity of (T) reserved for the production of the new 
capital goods; and we can distribute the remaining quantity between 
consumption in the form of services and consumption in the form of 
products, in accordance with the following formula:
bt Dt + ct Dc + dt Dd ++ St = Qt − (at Ωa + Kt′)
where Qt is the total quantity of service (T) and St the quantity dir-
ectly consumed. he other services are treated similarly.


Solution of the equations of capital formation and credit 287
he substitution of i″ for i′ in the tatonnement has led to equality of 
the total amount of new capital goods and the total excess of income 
over consumption because of changes in these two quantities that 
can be considered as a irst-order efect of the change of the rate of 
net income. But there is a second-order efect to be examined. If the 
total excess of income over consumption has increased or decreased 
at the prices pt′,, p′p ,, pk′, pk′′ , pk′′′ ,, pb′, pc′, pd′ ,, the amount 
of consumption will irst tend to decrease or increase; and, since 
the total quantities of consumable and productive services remain 
the same, all their prices, that are equal to the ratios of the raretés 
that have remained nearly constant of the commodities (T), , 
(P), , (K), (K′), (K″), , (B), (C), (D),  to the rareté of the com-
modity (A) demanded that have increased or decreased, fall or rise. 
It remains to understand what will be the efect of this decrease or 
increase on the new amount of new capital goods and on the total 
amount of excess of income over consumption. he irst quantity will 
decrease or increase because it is an increasing function of the prices 
pk′, pk′′ , pk′′′ , Regarding the second quantity, this will also decrease 
or increase because the amount of income decreases or increases with 
decreasing or increasing prices, and, as a result, the amount of con-
sumption and that of capital formation must both decrease or increase. 
Because the total amount of new capital formation and the excess 
of income over consumption both change into the same direction, 
the change of prices from pt′,, p′p ,, pk′, pk′′ , pk′′′ ,, pb′, pc′, pd′ ,, to 
pt′′,, p′p′,, pk′, pk′′′ , pk′′′′ ,, pb′′, pc′′, pd′′, will have moved them less 
far from equality than the change from i′ into i″ will have led them to 
move in the direction of equality. he system of the new rate of net 
income and of the new prices is therefore closer to equilibrium than 
the preceding one, and it is necessary only to continue the tatonne-
ment to approach it still more closely.
In this way, we would arrive at the equality

Now, the indicated tatonnement is exactly the one that happens in 
the market for capital goods, where the new capital goods are sold in 
accordance with the mechanism of bidding up prices and lowering 
them in proportion to their net incomes (§ 234); that is to say, when 
the amount of net income of the new capital goods is exchanged for 
the amount of the excess of income over consumption in accordance 
with the equation
Dk πk + Dk′ πk′ + Dk′′ πk′′ +
= iFe (pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,, pb , pc , pd ,,i),
where i represents the rate of net income, and 1
net income. i the price of a unit of 
251. Instead of assuming that the creators of the excess of income 
over consumption go in person to the market for capital goods in 
order to buy new capital goods that they subsequently hire out in 
the market for services to the entrepreneurs engaged in production, 
we now assume that the savers lend a part of the amount in numer-
aire of these capital goods to those entrepreneurs, and that the latter, 
instead of the savers, go to the market for capital goods to buy the 
new capital goods. In that market, nothing will change other than 
that the demand for new capital goods will be exercised by the entre-
preneurs engaged in production in place of being exercised by the 
creators of savings. And, consequently, the rate of net income will be 
determined there in the way we have indicated, except that in place 
of the market for services there will, for the hiring out of new capital 
goods, in part be substituted a market for numeraire capital in which 
there will be determined the price of numeraire capital, to be called 
rate of interest. Now, it is obvious that this rate of interest, if it is deter-
mined in accordance with the mechanism of bidding up prices and 
lowering them and the law of supply and demand, cannot difer at 
all from the rate of net income that we determined above. Indeed, if 
it were higher, it would be more advantageous for the creators of the 
excess to lend their capital in the form of numeraire in the market for 
numeraire capital, rather than to hire it out in kind in the market for 


Solution of the equations of capital formation and credit 289

services, and would, consequently move from the latter market to the 
former; whereas it would be advantageous for the entrepreneurs, on 
the contrary, to hire capital in kind in the market for services rather 
than to borrow it in the form of numeraire in the market for numer-
aire capital, moving, consequently, from the second to the irst mar-
ket. hus, the efective supply of numeraire capital increasing and its 
demand decreasing, the rate of interest would decrease. And if the 
rate of interest were lower than the rate of net income, the inverse 
phenomenon would take place, and, consequently, the efective 
supply of numeraire capital decreasing and its demand increasing, 
the rate of interest would increase. In this way, the rate of interest, 
which is the ratio of net proitiv to the price of movable capital, reveals 
itself, of course, in the market for numeraire capital; that is to say, in 
the banking system; but in reality it is determined as the rate of net 
income, which is the common ratio of the net price of a service to 
the price of the corresponding landed, personal, or movable capital, 
in the capital goods market, that is to say, in the stock market. We see 
here clearly that the key to the whole theory of capital is to be found 
in this elimination of lending capital in numeraire and the exclusive 
consideration of lending capital in kind. Since the market for numer-
aire capital is only of practical interest and not of theoretical import-
ance, we leave it aside and go back to the market for capital goods to 
ind there the equilibrium price of new capital goods.
252. Now, at the prices pk′′′, pk′′′′, pk′′′′′, of their services, the new cap-
ital goods (K), (K′), (K″),  will be sold at the prices

So, Πk ,Πk′ ,Πk′′ , are the prices of new capital goods, where 
Pk′′′,Pk′′′′,Pk′′′′′, are their average costs. hese prices and average costs 
being in general unequal, the entrepreneurs of new capital will make 
proits or losses expressed by the diferences
Dk′(Πk − Pk′′′), Dk′′ (Πk′ − Pk′′′′), Dk′′′ (Πk′′ − Pk′′′′′),.
It is not immediately clear, in the case of inequality of the prices and 
the average costs, how, by modifying the quantities Dk′,Dk′′ ,Dk′′′′ ,, we 
can bring the prices Πk and Pk′′′, Πk′ and Pk′′′′, Πk′′ and Pk′′′′′, to equal-
ity. his is due to the fact that we do not see immediately that these 
prices and average costs are functions of the quantities of new capital 
goods produced. But this circumstance is easy to make apparent.
Let us go back to the various systems of equations of capital for-
mation as these have been posited in the preceding section. Assume 
that we have introduced the values of pb, pc, pd,  given by the equa-
tions of system [5] into the equations of the systems [1], [2], and 
[3], and that then we introduce the values of Ot ,Op ,,Ok ,Ok′Ok′′ , 
and those of Da ,Db ,Dc ,Dd , given by the modiied systems [2] and 
[3] into the equations of system [4]; this system would then be a 
system of n equations in n + l + 1 unknowns, namely the n prices 
pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ , of the productive services, the l quantities 
of new capital goods Dk ,Dk′ ,Dk′′ , produced, and rate of net income i. 
Considering the l + 1 latter quantities as given and only the former 
n as unknowns, and assuming that we have successively eliminated 
n – 1 of these unknowns, we would inally obtain n equations of the 
following form, giving the prices of the services as functions of the 
quantities of new capital goods to be produced and the rate of net 
income:
pt = Ft (Dk ,Dk′ ,Dk′′ ,,i)

Ater that, assuming that we have introduced the values of 
pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ , given by these equations into those of 
systems [6] and [8], we would have inally two systems of l equa-
tions each, of which the one gives the average costs and the other the 
prices of new capital goods as functions of the quantities of new cap-
ital goods to be produced and of the rate of net income.
253. As we said above, we do not know the equations that give us 
pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ , as functions of Dk ,Dk′ ,Dk′′ , and i. 
However, it follows quite explicitly from the laws of the variation 
of the prices of the services that we have developed, that, given the 
inequalities

if we increase or decrease the quantity Dk , we increase or decrease 
somewhat, on the one hand, the price of all the services that enter into 
the production of the capital good (K); that is to say, we increase or 
decrease considerably the average cost of this capital good expressed 
by the irst member of the irst inequality given above, whereas, on 
the other hand, we decrease or increase considerably the price of the 


292 heory of capital formation and credit

service of the type of capital good (K); that is to say, we decrease 
or increase considerably the price of the capital good of this type as 
expressed by the second member of this same inequality. So, the irst 
member of the inequality is an increasing function and the second 
member is a decreasing function of the quantity of capital good (K) 
produced. Consequently, assuming, for example, Pk′′′> Πk , we could 
decrease Pk′′′ and increase Πk by decreasing Dk′; on the contrary, if 
Pk′′′< Πk , we could increase Pk′′′ and decrease Πk by increasing Dk′. 
Likewise, assuming Pk′′′′ Πk′ , we could decrease or increase Pk′′′′ and 
increase or decrease Πk′ by decreasing or increasing Dk′′. Likewise, if 
Pk′′′′′ Πk′′ , we could decrease or increase Pk′′′′′ and increase or decrease 
Πk′′ by decreasing or increasing Dk′′′ , and so forth.
Let Δk be the quantity of capital good (K) to be produced that, sub-
stituted for Dk′ in the functions Ft ,,Fp ,,Fk ,,Fk ,Fk′ ,Fk ″ ,, 
will change the irst inequality [above] to equality; let ∆k′ be the 
quantity of capital good (K′) to be produced that, substituted for Dk′′ 
in the functions Ft ,,Fp ,,Fk ,Fk′ ,Fk′′ ,, will change the second 
inequality to equality; let ∆k′′ be the quantity of capital good (K″) 
to be produced that, substituted for Dk′′′ in the same functions will 
change the third inequality to equality; and so forth. hese quan-
tities ∆k , ∆k′ , ∆k′′ , also substituted for Dk′, Dk′′, Dk′′′ , in the general 
tatonnement, then brought onto the market for capital goods and 
sold there in accordance with the mechanism of free competition, 
would be sold at prices that difer from the average costs, but would 
be closer to equality than the preceding prices were with respect to 
the preceding average costs. his is, at least, what must be estab-
lished, even for the case in which the changes of the quantities to be 
produced would be all in the same direction.
254. Let us assume that these changes are all increases of the quantities 
produced. he substitution of Δk for Dk′ would have changed the irst 
inequality to equality by an increase of pt ,, pp ,, pk′ , pk′′ , and a 
decrease of the price pk . he substitution of ∆k′′ for Dk′′, which then 
occurs, would have produced an increase of pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′′ , 
and a decrease of the price pk′. hen the substitution of ∆k′′′ for Dk′ ′′
would have produced an increase of pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , and a 
decrease of the price pk′′. And so forth. he equality of the average 


Solution of the equations of capital formation and credit 293

cost and the price of (K) would therefore have been disturbed by 
an increase of the prices pt ,, pp ,, pk ,v and by a decrease of 
the prices pk′ , pk′′ , he average cost would have been consider-
ably increased by the increase of the former prices, and at the same 
time decreased somewhat by the decrease of the latter prices. he 
price would have been increased by the increase of pk. Now, subject 
to these conditions, it is evident that the price and the average cost of 
capital goods (K) would not have been much displaced from equal-
ity by the increases in the quantities produced of (K′), (K″), … We 
would reason in the same way in the case of a general decrease of the 
quantities produced.
What has been said about the efect of the variations of the quan-
tities produced of (K′), (K″), … on the price and the average cost of 
(K), could be said about the efect of the variations of the quantities 
produced of (K), (K″), … on the price and the average cost of (K′), the 
efect of the variations of the quantities produced of (K), (K′), … on 
the price and the average cost of (K″), and so forth. Subject to these 
conditions, there is reason to believe that the change of the quantity 
produced of each new capital good has brought the price and the 
average cost of this capital nearer to equality than the changes of the 
quantities produced of the other new capital goods have displaced 
them from equality. he system of the new quantities to be produced 
and the new prices and average costs of new capital goods is therefore 
nearer to equilibrium than the preceding one, and we only have to 
continue the tatonnement in order to approach it more and more.
Combining this tatonnement with the preceding ones, we 
would determine certain quantities Dk′′, Dk′′′, Dk′′′′, … such that we

and the equations of system [8] would be satisied.
Now, this tatonnement is precisely the one that takes place auto-
matically in the market for products, subject to regime of free com-
petition, when the entrepreneurs manufacturing new capital goods, 
just like the entrepreneurs manufacturing other products, low 
toward the enterprises or turn away from them according to whether 
proits or losses are made in them.
255. Ater having carried out this tatonnement, we have, as we have 
seen (§248), calling paiv the average cost and Daiv the efective demand 
for (A),
Ωa paiv = Daiv
and there remains only to carry out the well-known tatonnement 
that leads simultaneously to the equality of the average cost of (A) 
to unity, and equality of its efective supply and efective demand 
(§ 215).
256. Bringing together all the elements of our demonstration, we for-
mulate thusly the law of the establishment of the equilibrium prices 
of new capital goods by the determination of the rate of net income:
– Given several services from the price of which it is possible to deduct an 
excess of income over consumption that will be transformed into new cap-
ital goods properly speaking, and that are exchanged for various consumable 
products and for various new capital goods with a numeraire as intermedi-
ary, then it is suicient and necessary for equilibrium in the market for these 
capital goods, or stationary prices in numeraire of all new capital goods, that: 
1° at the prices determined by the ratio of the net incomes and the common 
rate of net income, the efective demand for these new capital goods be equal 
to their efective supply, and, 2° the price of these new capital goods be equal 
to their average cost. When this double equality does not exist, it is neces-
sary, to arrive at the irst equality, to raise the prices by decreasing the rate of 
net income if efective demand is greater than efective supply and to lower 
the prices by increasing the rate of net income if efective supply is greater 
than efective demand; and, to arrive at the second equality, it is necessary to 
increase the quantity of new capital goods of which the price is greater than 
the average cost and to decrease the quantity of those of which the average cost 
is greater than the price.


Solution of the equations of capital formation and credit 295

Since the new capital goods properly speaking are nothing other 
than products, and since the condition of equality of their price to 
their average cost is an element of the principle of their cost of pro-
duction, it turns out that the principal result of this study is the deter-
mination of the rate of net income in the market for those capital 
goods, in accordance with the law of supply and demand. Before in-
ishing, let us make two remarks on these two points.
Let us irst remark, with regard to the determination of the prices 
of the new capital goods properly speaking, that the entrepreneurs 
who make these products, knowing beforehand the prices of the ser-
vices and the rate of net income, knowing beforehand the average 
cost and the price of their products, ind themselves, theoretically, 
in the same position as the entrepreneurs producing the numeraire 
commodity, who are free not to produce except in the case of proits 
and to refrain from production in the case of losses (§ 211).
Let us, in what follows, remember with regard to the rate of net 
income, that this rate having been determined, the rate of interest, 
which is the price of hiring numeraire capital, is determined, too, and 
has only to manifest itself in the market for this numeraire capital 
(§ 247). And let us remark that, from the moment that ixed capital 
is hired in the form of numeraire, nothing prevents that circulating 
capital be hired in the same form and at the same price (abstraction 
made of certain circumstances that are of practical but not theoret-
ical importance), since it makes absolutely no diference to the capit-
alist who lends numeraire if the borrowing entrepreneur transforms 
this numeraire into machines, instruments, tools or in raw materials 
in inventory and manufactured products on display for sale. In this 
way, the problem of hiring capital is completely solved by the deter-
mination of the rate of net income.

Notes
i Walras inserted the words ‘the equality of ’ in editions 2 and 3, and sup-
pressed them in editions 4 and 5. he insertion appears to be a mistake 
because he does not say to what the prices are equal. He probably meant the 
equality of average cost to the price of each product.
ii He meant the system of equations at the top of page 282.
iii See the last equation of system [3] of lesson 24.

iv his is an example of Walras using the word proit in the conventional sense, 
i.e., as revenue minus cost, inconsistently with his deinition of it as the ser-

LESSON 26

heorem of the maximum utility of new 
capital goods. Law of the variation of the rate 
of net income

SUMMARy: – here is maximum satisfaction of the needs of an 
exchanger when he has distributed his income among his diverse 
types of needs in such a way that the ratios of the raretés of the ser-
vices and the products to their prices are equal. here is maximum 
efective utility of new capital of which the services are consum-
able by a society when the excess of its income over consumption 
has been distributed among the diverse varieties of capital forma-
tion in such a way that the ratios of the gross incomes to the prices 
of the capital goods are equal. here is maximum efective utility 
of new capital goods that render productive services if the same 
condition is fulilled. Analytical deinition of free competition in 
matters of capital formation and credit. Law of the establishment 
of the variation in the rate of net income subject to the hypothesis 
of a constant excess of income over consumption.
257. I have promised (§ 239) to demonstrate that using the excess 
of income over consumption in such a way that the ratios of the net 
incomes to the prices of the new capital goods are equal is, subject 
to a certain reservation, the condition for maximum efective utility 
of the services of these new capital goods, just as using individual 
incomes in such a way that the ratios of the raretés of the services 
and products to the prices are equal is the condition for maximum 
efective utility of these services and products. he time has come to 
demonstrate these propositions.
Let δt ,,δp ,,δk ,δk′ ,δk′′ ,,δa ,δb ,δc ,δd , be quantities to 
keep or to buy, by an exchanger, of services (T), (P), (K), (K′), 
(K″),  and of products (A), (B), (C), (D),  at prices

be the equations expressing the efective utilities of the services 
(T), (P), (K), (K′), (K″),  and of products (A), (B), (C), (D),  
for this individual as functions of the quantities consumed. he 
derivatives of these functions being essentially decreasing, there 
will be maximum of efective utility, for our individual, when the 
diferential increments of the quantities consumed of each com-
modity are equal, since, if one assumes any two of these increments 
unequal, it will be advantageous to demand less of the commodity 
of which the diferential increment is less and to demand more of 
the commodity for which it is greater. he condition of the max-
imum satisfaction of wants can therefore be expressed by the equa-
tion system
Φt′ (δ)∂δt == Φ′p (δ)∂δp ==
Φk′ (δ)∂δk = Φk′′ (δ)∂δk′ = Φk′′′ (δ)∂δk′′ ==
Φ′a (δ)∂δa = Φ′b (δ)∂δb = Φ′c (δ)∂δc = Φd′ (δ)∂δd =
Now, on the one hand, the derivatives of the efective utility func-
tions with respect to the quantities consumed are nothing other than 
the raretés; and, on the other hand, from the point of view of the 


heorem of the maximum utility of new capital goods 299

distribution by an individual of a certain income over the diverse 
types of wants, the diferentials of these quantities consumed are 
inversely proportional to the prices, which are themselves the inverse 
ratios of the quantities of commodities exchanged in accordance with 
the equations
pt ∂δt == pp∂δp ==
pk∂δk = pk′∂δk′ = pk′′∂δk′′ ==
∂δa = pb∂δb = pc∂δc = pd ∂δd =

258. Now, initially making abstraction from the services of new cap-
ital goods used as productive services; that is to say, initially assuming 
that all those capital services are used as consumable services, let
Dk = δk,1 + δk,2 + δk,3 +
Dk′ = δk′,1 + δk′,2 + δk′,3 +
Dk′′ = δk′′,1 + δk′′,2 + δk′′,3 +



be quantities that are both the quantities of capital services (K), (K′), 
(K″),  consumed by exchangers (1), (2), (3), at prices pk , pk′ , pk′′ , 
respectively of these capital services in terms of (A), and the quan-
tities produced of new capital goods (K), (K′), (K″),  to be kept by 


300 heory of capital formation and credit
their owners or borrowed by consumers. Further, let Pk ,Pk′ ,Pk′′ , be 
the prices of the capital goods, such that we have
Dk Pk + Dk′Pk′ + Dk′′Pk′′ += E,
where E is the excess of total income over total consumption, to be 
distributed by the society among the l types of new capital goods.
Let, moreover,
u = Φ k,1 (q), u = Φ k′,1 (q), u = Φ k′′,1 (q),
be the equations expressing the efective utilities of the capital ser-
vices (K), (K′), (K″),  to trader (1) as functions of the quantities 
consumed of these services or of the quantities produced of these cap-
ital goods. he derivatives of these functions being strictly decreas-
ing, there will be a maximum of efective utility, for our exchanger, 
when the diferential increments of the quantities produced of each 
of the new capital goods are equal, since, if one assumes that any two 
of these increments are unequal, it will be advantageous to produce 
less of the capital good of which the diferential increment is less 
and to produce more of the capital good the increment of which 
is greater. he condition of maximum utility of the new capital 
goods for exchanger (1) can therefore be expressed by the equation 
system
Φ′k (δkk,1 )dδk,1 = Φ′k′ (δk′,1 )dδk′,1 = Φ′k′′ (δk′′,1 )dδk′′,1 =
Now, on the one hand, the derivatives of the efective utility func-
tions with respect to the quantities produced of each of the new 
capital goods, which are also the derivatives of these function with 
respect to the quantities of each of the capital services, are nothing 
other than the raretés, which are directly proportional to the prices

on the other hand, from the point of view that concerns us at pre-

of capital formation, the diferentials of the quantities produced of 
the various capital goods are inversely proportional to the prices

his demonstration does not say anything about the duration 
of the enjoyment of the service, and does not need to say anything 
about it. According to whether the duration is a year, a month, or 
a day, the ratio p

P will be the annual, monthly, or daily rate of net 
income. We have always considered up to this point that the rate is 
an annual one.
The demonstration also does not take into account the depre-
ciation and insurance of the capital goods; in other words, it 
assumes that these capital goods are indestructible and imper-
ishable, or that their depreciation and insurance are paid for vol-
untarily by the owners at their own expense. If we wished now 
to introduce the condition that the depreciation and insurance 
are paid for by the consumers of the services, we must, while 
leaving the maximum satisfaction to be established by the pro-
portionality of the raretés of the capital good services to their 
prices, add to the average cost of each capital-good unit the sum 
necessary to provide, at the rate of net income for the capital 
good, the amount of the depreciation and insurance. If this were 
the case, then, instead of being inversely proportional to the prices

goods were destined to generate consumable capital services. Now 
we must assume that the new capital goods are destined to generate 
productive services; that is to say, services that are not directly con-
sumed, but are used in the production of products, and see, in this 
case, what the condition for a maximum is.

there will be maximum efective utility of new capital goods for our 
exchanger when the sums of the individual diferential increments 
with respect to the quantities produced of each of these new capital 
goods will be equal, since, if any two of these sums are assumed to 
be unequal, then it will be advantageous to produce less of the cap-
ital good of which the sum of the individual diferential increments 
is less and produce more of the capital good for which this sum is 
greater. he only problem that arises here is that instead of the dif-
ferential increments relating to the quantities of each of these new 
capital goods presenting themselves separately from each other, we 
ind them mixed together in the sum of the diferential increments of 
utility relating to the quantities of products consumed, from which 
we have to disentangle them.

consumed of the products is the following:

maximum efective utility of the services of the new capital goods, for 
the society, when the ratio of the price of the capital service to the price

gross incomes. Consequently and, moreover, from our demonstra-
tion that free competition in matters of the creation of new capital 
constitutes the solution by tatonnement of the equations of capital 
formation and credit as we have posited them, it results that:
– Capital formation in a market characterized by the regime of free compe-
tition is an operation by means of which the excess of income over consump-
tion can be transformed into new capital goods properly speaking of a nature 
and in quantities such that they generate the greatest possible satisfaction of 
wants within the limits of the condition that all the capital goods in the market 
earn the same rate of net income; in other words, that the depreciation and 
insurance of the capital goods properly speaking are paid by the consumer of 
the capital services and not by the owner of the capital goods.


308 heory of capital formation and credit

Maximum efective utility on the one hand; singularity of price 
on the other, be it of the products in the market for products, be it of 
the services in the market for services, be it of the net incomes in the 
market for capital goods: such is in all cases the double condition in 
accordance with which the world of economic matters is organized, 
just as gravity being directly proportional to the mass and inversely 
proportional to the square of the distances is the double condition 
in accordance with which the world of astronomic movements auto-
matically regulates itself. In both cases, a formula of two lines con-
tains the whole science, and provides the explanation of a countless 
number of speciic facts.
Furthermore, an important truth that economists have stated, but 
not proved, is inally established, in spite of the denials by social-
ists, namely that free competition is, under certain conditions and 
within certain limits, a self-activating and self-regulating mechanism 
of transformation of savings into capital properly speaking, as well 
as of transformation of services into products. And so, in matters of 
capital formation and credit as well as in matters of exchange and 
production, the conclusion of economic theory provides us the start-
ing point for applied economics. In the one case as in the other, this 
conclusion moreover shows us clearly the task that social economics 
has to fulill. Free competition in matters of exchange and produc-
tion provides maximum utility of products and services subject to 
the reservation that there is only a single and unique exchange rate 
for all the services and all the products for all the exchangers. Free 
competition in capital formation and credit provides the maximum 
utility of new capital goods subject to the reservation that there is 
only a single and same ratio of net interest to capital for all the crea-
tors of savings. Are these reservations just? hat is for the moral the-
ory of the distribution of social wealth to say: and, only ater having 
done so, the economic theory of the production of social wealth will 
be able to pursue boldly in detail the application of the principle of 
free competition in agriculture, industry, commerce, banking, and 
speculation.

assume it to be given by the nature of things, we can state the very 
simple law of the establishment and the variation of the rate of net 
income:
– he rate of net income is equal to the ratio of the total net income 
of new capital goods to the total excess of income over consumption.
If, all other things remaining unchanged, the net income of one or 
several types of capital goods increases or decreases, the rate of net 
income increases or decreases.
If the excess of income over consumption increases or decreases, the 
rate of net income decreases or increases.

Now, from the simple inspection of these three systems of equa-
tions, we easily derive the following laws of the establishment and 
variation of the prices of capital goods:
– he equilibrium prices of the capital goods in terms of the numeraire in 
the market of these capital goods are equal to the ratios of the prices of net 
income to the rate of net income.
If, all other things remaining unchanged, the price of the gross income of a 
capital good increases or decreases, the price of the capital good increases or 
decreases.
If the rate of depreciation or the insurance premium increases or decreases, 
the price of the capital good decreases or increases.
If, all other things remaining unchanged, the rate of net income increases or 
decreases, the prices of all capital goods decrease or increase.

263. It is essential, however, to note that the prices thus obtained are, 
in a way, nominal prices; that is to say, established without exchange 
occurring. If in the market for products the equilibrium price is 
established, the exchange of these products takes place immediately; 
in the market for capital goods, on the contrary, exchange does not 
necessarily take place under the rational and ideal conditions we 
have introduced. Undoubtedly, prices in terms of numeraire have 
been determined; but, looking more closely to the matter, we see 
that these prices come down, at last, to a single price, namely the 
price of a unit of net income in terms of numeraire. If the rate of 
net income i is equal, for instance, to 3/100, 2.5/100, 2/100, , the 
price in numeraire of a capital good having a net income equal to 1 
will be 1/i, equal to 33.33, 40, 50,  However, given all this, what 


312 heory of capital formation and credit

motivation is there to exchange net income for net income, to sell, 
for example, a house that yields a net rent of 2,500 francs at a price 
of 100,000 francs, in order to purchase at the price of 100,000 francs 
a piece of land yielding 2,500 francs of rent? his exchange of capital 
goods for each other makes no more sense than the exchange of a 
commodity for the same commodity. For these sales and purchases 
to take place in a capital goods market, we must borrow from reality 
and experience some essential circumstances. So, we must take into 
consideration that, in addition to the people who have an excess of 
their income over their consumption, and who are able to buy cap-
ital goods, there are, as we have already said (§ 236), people who 
have an excess of their consumption over their income, and have to 
sell capital goods. We must also bear in mind that the net income 
of new capital goods is not as well known as that of existing capital 
goods, that it may be greater or smaller, that it is, in a word, more 
uncertain. From this it results that the creators of savings, who are 
in general prudent and circumspect, do not hand over their savings 
in exchange for new capital goods but rather in exchange for existing 
capital goods; and then it is the owners of these existing capital goods 
who, with the proceeds, invest in new capital goods. In our course in 
applied economics we will have to study especially the role of these 
speculators, who intervene in this way to evaluate new capital goods. 
Further, it should be observed that the price of capital goods not only 
varies because of unexpected changes, but also because of expected 
changes in either gross income, or in the depreciation rate or insur-
ance premium, and that, concerning the expected changes espe-
cially, the evaluations difer from individual to individual. Hence, 
many people sell capital goods whose net income they fear, rightly 
or wrongly, will decrease, to buy other capital goods that they expect, 
rightly or wrongly, to have an increase in net income. hat is another 
type of speculation that we will have to study together with the type 
we mentioned above. Moreover, the exchange of new or existing cap-
ital, once decided, will take place in accordance with the mechanism 
of free competition and the law of supply and demand.
264. of the three equation systems of the capital market, there is one 
that has a particular importance: the one relating to movable capital 
goods. Indeed, the identical character of the gross and net income 


Determination and variation of the prices of capital goods 313

of land eliminates a two-fold cause of variation in their price: that of 
changes of the rate of depreciation and that of changes of insurance 
premiums. Regarding personal faculties, they are not sold or bought 
because slavery is not allowed. here remain, therefore, capital goods 
properly speaking, whose gross income is generally far from unchan-
ging, and for which the depreciation rates and insurance premiums 
are as changeable as are the factors on which they depend: the chances 
of deterioration due to usage and of accidental demolishment; the 
price of those capital goods is, consequently, very changeable, and 
they are daily sold and bought for the sake of speculation. hus, just 
as there is reason, in the market for services, to distinguish the market 
for hiring capital properly speaking from the markets for hiring land 
and personal faculties, there is reason, regarding the capital goods 
market, to distinguish the market for movable capital goods from 
the market for landed capital and for personal capital. his market 
for movable capital is the Bourse, which we visited at the beginning 
of this course in economic theory, to look there for the description 
of the mechanism of free competition in exchange (§ 42), and that 
we subsequently neglected until the present ater having successively 
taken account of all the complications of exchange, production, cap-
ital formation, and credit. We have, in the equation system [8], the 
means of discussing all the price variations that can occur in it. If 
capital good (K) is a railway, and pk is a sum to be received annu-
ally as dividend, the price Pk of the shares of this railway company 
in terms of numeraire will change with the variations, unexpected 
or not, in this dividend. If the capital good (K′) is a capital good lent 
to a factory or to the state, and νk′ is a premium corresponding with 
the risk of collapse of the factory or the nation, the price Pk′ of the 
obligations of the factory or the state will change with the variations, 
unexpected or not, in these risks. Moreover, these price variations 
will oten be purely nominal or, at least, will occur almost without 
transferring securities.
265. If the price Pk is increased indeinitely, it tends to become pro-
gressively greater than the ratio of its net income to the rate of net 
income; and, consequently, the demand for capital good (K) is 
decreased indeinitely. At the same time, the supply of the same cap-
ital good is increased indeinitely, because its owners, by exchanging 


314 heory of capital formation and credit

it for other capital goods, will be able to procure for themselves a 
growing income. he reverse results would occur in the case of indef-
inite decreases of the price of capital good (K). hat is how, in the 
Bourse, bidding up or lowering the price will always decrease or 
increase the demand and increase or decrease the supply, which does 
not take place, as we have seen (§§ 48, 59, 97, 126, 211), in the mar-
kets of products and services.
266. We remember that we have made abstraction from the elem-
ents of production identiied under the headings 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13  
(§ 175). It is not, for us, of pressing interest to ind out how the respect-
ive quantities of capital goods, income, and money included under 
these varied headings are determined, and without any inconvenience, 
we can consider them as resulting, in a certain economic situation, 
from the nature of the things; that is to say, from the very conditions 
of production and consumption, except that we will return later to 
this subject in a special part on money. But, ater this simpliication, it 
is worthwhile to notice the efects of the creation of a greater or lesser 
fund of working capital in either consumption or production.
We still assume a market for exchange and production in which 
certain productive services are transformed into products, ixed cap-
ital, and, inally, into circulating capital. With respect to the latter, let 
da ,db ,dc ,dd , be the quantities of (A), (B), (C), (D),  in the hands 
of consumers destined for consumption; let da′,da′′ be the quantities 
of (A) in the hands of the consumers constituting circulating money 
and savings; let pb , pc , pd , be the prices of (B), (C), (D),  in terms

and as stocks of raw materials in the hands of the entrepreneurs; 
let δ′a be their quantity of (A) held as circulating money; and let 
Pk ,Pk′ ,Pk′′ ,, pm , pm′ , pm′′ , be the prices of (K), (K′), (K″),  and 
(M), (M′), (M″),  in terms of (A). here will then be a fund of work-

he totality of these two funds of working capital, c + κ, will form 
the society’s circulating capital C′. Moreover, if Qk ,Qk′ ,Qk′′ , are the 
quantities of (K), (K′), (K″), capital goods properly speaking in the 
hands of the consumers or the producers destined to render con-
sumption or productive services, there will be ixed capital valued at
C = Qk Pk + Qk′ Pk′ + Qk′′ Pk′′ +
and the totality of circulating capital and this ixed capital, C′ + C, 
will form the total capital K of the society that, theoretically, can be 
considered as being lent and borrowed in the market for numeraire 
capital at the interest rate i equal to the rate of net income (§ 256).
267. We do not introduce the quantities da, da′, da′′, δa ,δa′, 
db ,δb ,dc ,δc ,dd ,δd ,,δk, δk′ ,δk′′ , in the equations of pro-
duction and capital formation in addition to the quantities 
Da ,Db ,Dc ,Dd ,,Dk ,Dk′ ,Dk′′ , to which they are added, all the 
more so as there is nothing more simple and easy than to assume the 
former magnitudes are included in the latter. It will be suicient for 
us to observe that it follows quite obviously from the equations of 
production and capital formation that any increase of the quantities 
Da ,Db ,Dc ,Dd , with a view to the creation of circulating capital 
will require a decrease of the quantities Dk ,Dk′ ,Dk′′ , because of the 
reduction of ixed capital, and that, conversely, each reduction of the 
quantity of circulating capital will permit an increase in the quantity 
of ixed capital.
268. Having said all that, and having restored all the accessory phe-
nomena from which we abstracted, we pass from the hypothesis of a 
market that is held continuously, to that of a market that is held peri-
odically, we could say once per day, we will say rather once per year 
to take better account of the renewal of the seasons. And, to make the 


316 heory of capital formation and credit

general system of economic phenomena completely understandable, 
we pass at the same time from abstract igures to concrete igures.
Assume that there is a country with about 25 to 30 million inhab-
itants that has land with a total value of T = 80 billion, persons val-
ued at P = 50 billion, and ixed and circulating capital; that is to say, 
capital goods properly speaking and incomes having a total value of  
K = 60 billion. he rate of net income is i = 2.5/100; the land yields 
an annual rent of 2 billion; the persons earn a gross personal income 
of 5 billion, of which 1,250 million is net income and 3 750 million 
is depreciation and insurance premiums that they spend on the sub-
sistence, the upbringing, and the instruction of their families (§ 233); 
the capital goods properly speaking yield a gross income of k = 3 
billons, of which 1,500 million is net income and 1,500 million is 
depreciation and insurance premiums, used by the capitalists to buy 
new capital goods properly speaking, in addition to the new capital 
goods properly speaking that could be bought by these same capital-
ists or by landowners and workers by means of their savings properly 
speaking.
Assume that 32 billion of landed capital render consumable ser-
vices, and 48 billion render productive services; that 14 billion of 
personal capital render consumable services, and 36 billion render 
productive services; that total capital is divided into 40 billion of ixed 
capital and 20 billion of circulating capital; that 12 billion of the ixed 
capital render consumable services, and 28 billion render product-
ive services; that 4 billion of circulating capital is in the hands of the 
consumers, namely 2 billion of stocks of consumable products and 
2 billion in the form of circulating money and savings, and that 16 
billion are in the hands of the entrepreneurs, namely 4 billion as new 
capital, 4 billion as stocks of raw materials, 6 billion as new income 
goods, and 2 billion as circulating money. We thus readily encounter 
our 13 headings of the elements of production (§ 174).
269. It is quite understandable that there is a certain ratio between 
the igure for circulating capital and the igures for annual produc-
tion and consumption. It may be that for an annual production and 
consumption of 10 billion there has to be 100 billion worth of busi-
ness, that is, of transactions: the entrepreneurs do not only sell to 
consumers, they sell raw materials and commodities at wholesale to 


Determination and variation of the prices of capital goods 317

each other. Now, to do a certain amount of business, each entrepre-
neur needs some working capital. he ratio of the fund of working 
capital to the total amount of business difers, however, for each type 
of production. here are certain agricultural products, like wine, the 
production of which takes a whole year: for these goods, the fund 
of working capital must be equal to the total annual turnover. here 
are certain commercial products, like fruits and vegetables, that are 
bought wholesale in the morning and sold at retail during the day: 
for these products, the fund of working capital is only one three hun-
dredth of the total turnover. We have to use an average. Assuming 
a turnover of 100 billion and an amount of circulating capital of 20 
billion means that we have assumed an average period of production 
of one ith of a year.
270. We must properly understand that the total sum T + P + K 
= 190 billion represents without exception all the social wealth of 
the country, in capital and income, and that the symbols t, p, k 
represent nothing other than the proportions in which the land, 
the personal faculties, and the ixed and circulating capital contrib-
ute to production, and also in which the landowners, the workers, 
and the capitalists share in the consumption of the annual income 
t + p + k = 10 billion. his annual income of 10 billion consists of 
3 billion of land services, personal capital, and ‘proits’ that are 
directly consumed either by the owners of the landed capital, per-
sonal faculties, and movable capital, or by the purchasers of the 
land services, labor, and ‘proits’, be they either private persons 
or the state; the other 7 billion of annual income consists of land 
services, labor, and capital good services to be transformed into 
products by agriculture, industry, or commerce. We may assume, 
if we wish, that of the 10 billion of annual income, 8 billion of 
are consumed and 2 billion are capitalized, of which 1,500 million 
are used for depreciation and insurance of existing capital goods 
properly speaking, and 500 million for the creation of new capital 
goods properly speaking.
271. Finally, in order to approach closer and closer to the reality of 
things, we must still pass from the hypothesis of a periodic annual 
market to the hypothesis of a permanent market. For this, we imagine 


318 heory of capital formation and credit

now that both the yearly production and the yearly consumption to 
which we have given numbers above are spread over all the days of 
the year. he 2 billion of stocks of consumable products, the 4 bil-
lion of new capital goods, the 4 billion of stocks of raw materials, 
and the 6 billion of new income are thus like as many stems that are 
incessantly cut at their ends. At each hour, each minute, a fraction of 
these varied components of the fund of working capital disappears 
and reappears. Personal capital, capital goods properly speaking, 
and money likewise disappear and reappear, but much less rapidly. 
only landed capital escapes from this renewal. his is the permanent 
market, always tending to equilibrium without ever arriving there, 
because it can only move there by means of tatonnements, and before 
the tatonnements are inished they start anew, on a new basis, all the 
data of the problem, such as the quantities possessed, the utilities of 
the products and services, the coeicients of production, the excess 
of income over consumption, the fund of working capital required, 
etc., having changed. In this respect, the market is like a lake agitated 
by the wind; the water is always seeking its equilibrium without ever 
attaining it. here are, however, days when the surface of the lake is 
nearly horizontal; but there are none in which the efective supply of 
services and products equals their efective demand and the prices of 
the products are equal to their average costs in terms of productive 
services. he diversion of productive services from enterprises where 
losses are incurred toward enterprises that make proits takes places 
in many ways, of which the use of credit is a principal one, but, in all 
cases, in slow ways. It may happen, and in reality it does frequently, 
that sometimes the price continually remains above the average cost 
and that the increase of production cannot stop the price increase, 
and that sometimes a fall of the price, following upon that rise, sud-
denly changes the average cost from being below to being above the 
level of the price, and forces the entrepreneurs to reverse their course. 
For example, just as the lake is sometimes profoundly agitated by the 
storm, so also is the market sometimes violently perturbed by cri-
ses, which are sudden and general disturbances of equilibrium. We 
will study these crises, and we will see that we would be better able 
to suppress or prevent them if we had a better understanding of the 
conditions of the ideal equilibrium of exchange and production.

LESSON 28

Increase of the quantity of products. Laws 
of the general variation of prices in a 
progressive society

SUMMARy: – he possibility of a decrease in the coeicients of 
the use of land services due to an increase of the coeicients of the 
use of capital good services allows for indeinite progress; that is to 
say, the indeinite decrease of the raretés for an indeinitely grow-
ing population. Production function: technical progress because of 
a change of the nature of this function; economic progress because 
of a change of the value of the variables in this function. Condition 
for progress: increase in the amount of capital goods properly 
speaking that precedes and exceeds the increase in the numbers of 
persons. Malthus’s theory of population and subsistence.
he prices of the products do not vary. Hypothesis of a society 
where the quantity of land has not changed, but the number of 
persons has doubled, and in which the amount of capital goods 
properly speaking has at least doubled. he disturbed equilibrium 
will be reestablished by an increase in rent and a decrease in inter-
est. he rate of net income decreases. Consequently, the prices of 
capital goods do not change; those of personal faculties and of 
land increase.
272. It is hardly necessary to say that the principle of the proportion-
ality of the values of products and services to their raretés, in a state 
of general equilibrium of the market (§ 220), and the law of varia-
tions in the equilibrium prices, because of variations in the raretés 
due to either variations in the utilities or in the quantities possessed 
(§ 223), remain completely valid ater as well as before the solution 
of the equations of capital formation. But, on the other hand, the fact, 
which we observed when stating these equations (§§ 232–4), that the 


320 heory of capital formation and credit

quantity of land does not increase along with the possible increase 
in the number of persons and the amount of capital goods properly 
speaking, in a society that saves and creates capital, has extremely 
important consequences that we still have to formulate in laws that 
are among the most important ones for the completion of the theory 
of the establishment of prices in terms of numeraire. he laws are 
those of the variation of prices in a progressive economy.
273. We have included among the data and not among the unknowns 
of the problem the coeicients of production at ,bt ,ct ,dt ,,k ,k′,k′′,
, ,,kt ,kt′,kt′′, ap ,bp ,cp ,dp ,,kp ,kp′,kp′′, ak ,bk ,ck ,dk ,,kk ,kk′,kk′′,, 
ak′ ,bk′ ,ck′ ,dk′ ,,kk′ ,kk′′ ,kk′′′ ,, ak′′ ,bk′′ ,ck′′ ,dk′′ ,, kk′′ ,kk′′′ ,kk′′′′ , 
or the respective quantities of each of the productive services (T), 
(P), (K),  (K′), (K″),  that are used in the manufacture of each 
of the products (A), (B), (C), (D),  and of each of the new cap-
ital goods properly speaking (K), (K′), (K″),  We have explained  
(§ 200) why we allowed ourselves to consider for the time being these 
quantities as determined a priori, all the while stating that they are 
not. Indeed, they are not, neither with respect to their value nor with 
respect to their nature. his circumstance is decisive; it has far-reach-
ing consequences.
If we always needed ixed quantities of land services of type (T) 
for manufacturing one unit of (A), of (B), of (C), of (D),  of (K), of 
(K′), of (K″),  the multiplicationi of these products and these new 
capital goods would be limited in an absolute sense by the existing 
quantity Qt of land of this type. If, for example, 1/10 of the annual 
services of a hectare of land were always needed for the production 
of one hectoliter of wheat, or, to put it otherwise, if a hectare of land 
could never produce more than 10 hectoliters per year, the multipli-
cation of wheat would be limited in an absolute sense by the exist-
ing quantity of land suitable for the cultivation of wheat. However, 
everybody knows that the situation is diferent. Due to the substi-
tution of the system of letting land lie fallow in place of the system 
of crop rotation, due to the use of fertilizers like guano, of machines 
that work deeper into the ground or work more eiciently, of seed-
ing machines, a hectare of land can produce annually a greater and 
greater number of hectoliters of wheat. Furthermore, ordinarily, in 
manufacturing products and new capital goods, we can use smaller 


Increase of the quantity of products 321

and smaller quantities of land services, provided that greater and 
greater quantities of the services of capital goods properly speaking 
are used. herefore, indeinite progress is possible.
Progress cannot consist in anything other than the decrease in the 
raretés or the intensities of the last wants satisied by the products 
in a growing population. Hence, whether progress is possible or not 
depends on whether multiplication of the products is possible or not. 
If multiplication of products is possible only within certain limits, 
progress would be possible only within certain limits. he raretés 
could not decrease below a certain point, the population remaining 
constant; or the population could not grow above a certain point, the 
raretés remaining constant, or the raretés could not decrease below 
a certain point, the population itself growing up to a certain point. If 
the multiplication of the products is indeinitely possible, indeinite 
progress is possible. Now, indeinite multiplication of the products 
is possible because of the possibility of more and more, but never 
total, substitution in production of capital good ‘proits’ii in place of 
land services. Two cases have to be distinguished. he case in which 
only the coeicients of production of land services diminish, and in 
which there is an increase in those of the use of ‘proits’. We call this 
economic progress. And there is the case in which the very nature of 
these coeicients of production changes because of the use of difer-
ent productive services and the abandonment of certain others. We 
call this technical progress. But since this distinction is essential, it 
will be good to clarify it mathematically.
274. Assume there is a commodity (B) the production of one unit 
of which requires respectively the quantities bt ,bp ,bk , of the pro-
ductive services (T), (P), (K), ; its average cost is therefore
pb = bt pt + bp pp + bk pk +
To say, as we have done, that in manufacturing a product we can use 
more or less of such and such productive services, more or less land 
services, for example, under the condition of using less or more of 
such and such other productive services, less or more ‘proits’ or labor, 
for instance, is the same as saying that the coeicients of production 
bt ,bp ,bk , are variables connected with each other by an equation


322 heory of capital formation and credit
ϕ(bt ,bp ,bk ,) = 0 iii
such that when one of the coeicients, bt, is decreasing, one of the 
other coeicients, bp ,bk ,, is increasing. And to say, as we have also 
done, that the respective quantities of each of the productive services 
that are used in the manufacture of a unit of any of the products 
are determined only ater the determination of the prices of the pro-
ductive services, by the condition that the average cost be a min-
imum, is the same as saying, the implicit function above being solved 
successively for each of its variables or expressed successively in its 
explicit forms
bt = J(bp ,bk ,), bp = ψ(bk ,bk ,), bk = χ(bt ,bp ,),
that the unknown variables bt ,bp ,bk , are determined by the 
condition that
pb = J(bp ,bk ,) pt + ψ(bk ,bk ,) pp + χ(bt ,bp ,) pk +
be minimized. It is this condition that we said, inally, would be easy 
to represent by a system of as many equations as there are unknowns 
to be determined. We will not furnish here this expression any more 
than we did in the theory of production; indeed, we will only state 
that from now onwards when the production function changes, we 
always have a case of technical progress brought about by science, 
and that when, without any change in the production function, the 
coeicients of the use of land services are decreasing and those of 
the use of ‘proits’ are increasing, we always have a case of economic 
progress brought about by saving. In reality, those two forms of pro-
gress occur together; it can happen that the production function 
changes and that, simultaneously, the coeicients of production of 
land services decrease and those of capital good services increase. 
But here we abstract from technical progress and consider only eco-
nomic progress; that is to say, assuming the production function to 
be determined, we will study the conditions of decreasing the coef-
icients of production of land services by means of increasing those 
of the use of ‘proits’.


Increase of the quantity of products 323

275. hat condition is evident. he quantity of land does not increase 
in the progressive state; and precisely for that reason it is a question 
of obtaining more products with the same, or more or less the same, 
total quantity of land services. Since population growth is assumed 
by the very deinition of progress, the number of persons increases; 
hence, it is certain that there is a supplement of labor that is by its 
nature proportional to the supplement of products to be obtained. 
So, what remains to be desired? hat the amount of capital goods 
increases to such a degree that the necessary supplement of ‘prof-
its’ will be furnished. Under the assumption of pure and simple eco-
nomic progress, this supplement would be quite substantial: indeed 
it would not be suicient for it to be proportional to the supplement 
of products to be obtained; it must also compensate for the absence 
of a proportional supplement of land services, and, moreover, it 
must also permit a supplement of products more than proportional 
to the population growth to be obtained, because of the decrease of 
the raretés. Furthermore, it is obvious that the capital goods must be 
created by savings before their services can be used. Consequently: – 
Progress consisting in the decrease in the raretés of the productsiv with 
the increase in the number of persons is, in spite of the fact that the 
quantity of land does not increase, possible due to the increase in the 
amount of capital goods properly speaking, subject to the essential con-
dition that the increase in the amount of capital goods properly speak-
ing precedes and exceeds the increase in the number of persons. We 
have good reason to present here the controversial theory of Malthus 
on population and subsistence.
276. As we know, this theory is contained in its entirety in the follow-
ing passages of Malthus’s book:1,v
It may safely be pronounced, therefore, that population, when unchecked, 
goes on doubling itself every twenty-ive years, or increases in a geometrical 
ratio.
It may be fairly pronounced, therefore, that, considering the present aver-
age state of the earth, the means of subsistence, under circumstances the 
most favorable to human industry, could not possibly be made to increase 
faster than in an arithmetical ratio.

1 [homas] Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population, Book I, Chapter I.


324 heory of capital formation and credit

[Taking the whole earth, instead of this island, emigration would of 
course be excluded; and, supposing the present population equal to a thou-
sand millions,] the human species would increase as the numbers, 1, 2, 4, 8, 
16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and subsistence as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. In two centuries 
the population would be to the means of subsistence as 256 to 9; in three 
centuries as 4096 to 13, and in two thousand years the diference would be 
almost incalculable.
he irst of these two propositions is not absolutely rigorous. It is 
obvious that, from one generation to the other, population growth 
tends to take place, abstraction made from the means of subsist-
ence, or takes place, where the means are not lacking, according to a 
geometric series, the ratio of which is equal to half the number of a 
woman’s children that survive her. Malthus assumes this number to 
be equal to four, the population doubling from generation to gener-
ation. his is an estimate that is less than rather than greater than is 
true in reality, because mankind does not escape the law, well known 
nowadays, according to which all sorts of plants and animals tend 
to perpetuate themselves by a rapid and considerable multiplication. 
he consequences deduced by Darwin from this fact are contested, 
but the fact itself is not.
he second quotation is far from having the same validity. Malthus 
made no distinction between technical and economic progress. But 
he seems to be equally speculative in asserting that the increase in 
the quantity of means of subsistence resulting, on the one hand, 
from the discovery of wheat or of potatoes, from the invention of 
machines, or from the improvement of credit, or, on the other hand, 
from the increase resulting from the growth of capital, takes place 
according to an arithmetic sequence with a diference equal to one. 
Such kinds of assertions are not based on reason or experience, and it 
is ininitely better to restrict oneself to saying that the increase in the 
amount of subsistence resulting both from technical progress and 
from economic progress takes place according to a less rapid pro-
gression than that of population growth.
277. A society in which nearly all the land is cultivated, and where it 
is only possible to produce some landed capital artiicially by spread-
ing fertile earth over rocks, fertilizing moors, or draining swamps 
(§ 170) is therefore, and ater all, like the situation of an individual 


Increase of the quantity of products 325

who has a certain income and who consumes a certain part of it. If 
this individual keeps his consumption below his income, and capi-
talizes the excess, he increases his income more and more and can 
increase his consumption more and more; but if he raises his con-
sumption all at once above his income, he goes headlong to his ruin-
ation. Likewise, if a society irst develops its capital, its population 
can later grow indeinitely; but otherwise, it will fall straightaway 
into misery and starvation. And the latter will be the case as long 
as the labor of personal faculties is not the only productive factor in 
agriculture and industry, and as long as more ‘proits’ must be used 
in order to use less land services. We do not start out with that prop-
osition, as will be seen later, in order to go along with Malthus as far 
as maintaining the thesis that social reforms are hardly of import-
ance; but neither can we deny him the credit of having made appar-
ent a very important proposition in economic theory. he late Jules 
Duval exclaimed one day, sitting beside me at the Economics Society 
of Paris: ‘How is that? you are delighted when a calf is born, but you 
are not when a human being is born!’ Just as we made him see then, 
we now point to the fact that, between the two cases, there is the 
diference between having an additional dish on the table and hav-
ing an additional guest at the table. All reservations having been 
made about the desirability of the consequences of the application of 
Malthus’s theory, we must nevertheless admit that the two cases are 
not entirely the same thing.
278. We have discussed at length, without having arrived at any 
serious and deinitive conclusion in one direction or the other, the 
question whether the price of products would increase or decrease 
in a progressive society. Here is how we have to answer this ques-
tion. What necessarily decreases in a progressive society is the raretés  
(§ 270vi). Regarding the prices, which are the ratios of these raretés to 
the raretés of the numeraire good, they will remain unchanged if, as 
there is no reason not to assume, at the same time as the raretés of all 
the products other than the numeraire good decrease, the raretés of 
the numeraire also decrease proportionally. hey will decrease only 
if the raretés of the numeraire good do not change. only under the 
condition of this hypothesis that the raretés of the numeraire good 
do not change, may we say that in a progressive society, the prices 


326 heory of capital formation and credit

of products will decrease. J.-B. Say subscribed to the proposition as 
stated, while, however, confessing that he was unable to prove it. His 
remarkable sagacity served him well on this point, just as on several 
others; he was only lacking a more powerful method of research: for, 
as can be seen, the explication of the question here under discussion 
rests entirely on a complete mathematical analysis of the phenom-
enon of the establishment and of the variation of the prices.
279. Having said this regarding the prices of products, let us now 
proceed to the prices of services.
To ix our ideas, and to study the efects of progress while keep-
ing all other things equal as far as possible, let us assume there is 
a society like the one that we have considered until now, in which 
a certain number of individuals, having certain utility or want 
curves, possess certain amounts of capital: land, personal faculties, 
and capital properly speaking, the number of which would, at a 
given time, be doubled by progress. It is obvious that, if a second 
society, in all aspects identical to the irst one, were to be purely 
and simply added to the irst one, the prices of the services would 
not change, nor those of the products. his results mathematically 
from the equations of production. But such a hypothesis is not in 
accordance with the experientially derived idea of progress. What 
we must assume is that, to form the new society, every individual 
in the original society be succeeded ater some time by two other 
individuals each possessing, before the process of production and 
exchange starts:
1° he same utility or want curves;
2° Half of the same land;
3° An equal amount of the same personal faculties;
4° Such a proportionally greater amount of the same capital goods 
properly speaking as is necessary to allow the entrepreneurs to prod-
uce, with the same quantity of land, and with twice the quantity of 
personal faculties and labor, at least double the quantity of each of 
the products.
In this way, each member of the original society would have been 
replaced by two members of the new society who, ater the process of 
production and exchange, can consume directly:


Increase of the quantity of products 327

1° Half of the same land services;
2° An equal quantity of the same labor performed by personal 
faculties;
3° A proportionally much greater amount of the same ‘proits’ of 
capital goods properly speaking;
4° An at least equal quantity of the same products.

280. In these conditions, general equilibrium would not exist in the 
market for the new society at the same prices as those in the original 
society. It is immediately apparent that, of the two series of ratios of 
the raretés of the land services directly consumed to the raretés of the 
numeraire good, and those of the ‘proits’ directly consumed to the 
raretés of the numeraire good, the irst ratios are very much greater, 
and the second very much less than the original prices of these land 
services and these ‘proits’, that is, to the rents and to interest. here 
would be an immediate efective demand for land services and an 
efective supply of ‘proits’ to be consumed directly: an increase of 
rent and a decrease of interest. hat is certain; but it is easy to show 
that, if we assume that these increases in the price of the land ser-
vices and decreases in the price of the ‘proits’ are efectuated without 
delay, general equilibrium is, if not entirely reestablished, at least well 
on the way to being reestablished.
If rent has increased and interest decreased, there will be very 
nearly maximum satisfaction as far as regards directly consumed 
land services and directly consumed ‘proits’. Moreover, there is max-
imum satisfaction as far as regards directly consumed labor services. 
Hence, there is equilibrium, or close to it, with respect to the prices 
of services.
he entrepreneurs that make products pay higher land rent, but 
they use less land services in the manufacture of the products. hey 
pay less interest, but they use more ‘proits’ in the manufacture of the 
products. Hence the average costs of the products are almost exactly 
the same and are equal, or almost exactly equal, to their prices.
he landowners, workers, and capitalists, as consumers, sell less 
land services, but they sell them for higher prices. hey sell more 
‘proits’, but they sell them more cheaply. So, they have almost exactly 
the same income, and can obtain, or very nearly obtain, at least an 


328 heory of capital formation and credit

equal quantity of the same products at the same prices that match 
their average costs.
And inally, since the various ratios of the raretés of the prod-
ucts, which have decreased somewhat, to the raretés of the numer-
aire good, which also have decreased somewhat, are still equal to 
the price, there will be very nearly maximum satisfaction regarding 
the products, and equilibrium, or close to it, at the prices of these 
products.
his demonstration suices to allow us to state: – In a progressive 
society, the price of labor, or wages, does not change markedly, the price 
of land services, or rent, increases markedly, and the price of ‘proit’, or 
interest, decreases markedly.
281. he capital goods properly speaking are products. If we take 
into account that, because of this reason, their price, equal to their 
average cost, does not vary, whereas the price of ‘proits’, or interest, 
decreases markedly, we infer: – In a progressive society, the rate of net 
income decreases markedly.
282. he rate of net income is thus given by the ratio of net inter-
est to the price of capital goods properly speaking. once this has 
been obtained, we obtain the price of the personal faculties and of 
the land services by dividing the net wage and the rent by this rate 
of net revenue. And because the wages do not change markedly and 
rent increases markedly, it follows that: – In a progressive society, the 
price of personal faculties increases in proportion to the decrease of the 
rate of net income, and the price of land increases both in proportion to 
the decrease of the rate of net income and in proportion to the increase 
of rent.
283. I will show very shortly how the triple theory of rent, wages, 
and interest that is implicitly comprised in the theory, explained just 
above, of the determination of the price of the services, is in accord-
ance with the current theories or difers from them. Concerning only 
the theory of land services or of rent, I want to note immediately how 
one can see, in the theory here explained, that the value of land ser-
vices comes into existence in a society as a result of the same causes 
that make that value increase, and increases by the same causes as 


Increase of the quantity of products 329

those that bring it into existence. his value is always proportional 
to the raretés, or the intensities of the last wants satisied of the land 
services directly consumed. In a society that has just passed from 
the hunting and ishing stage to the pastoral or agricultural stage, 
everyone inds as much free land and land services as they want, not 
only for agriculture but also for building a dwelling and making a 
garden. he raretés and, therefore, the value of land services and land 
are zero. on the contrary, in a society having reached the industrial 
and commercial stage, people live in very large houses, and the parks 
gradually disappear. he raretés and, therefore, the value of the land 
services and land are substantial. he economists who, like Carey 
and Bastiat, have taken upon themselves to convince us that we are 
not paying rent while buying agricultural or other products should 
prove to us that we have as much free land as we want for our houses 
and our gardens, situated where we want to live, of course, not in 
the solitudes of Africa or America; but they do not give that proof, 
and will never give it. he truth is that the more and more consider-
able growth of the value of land services or rent, occurring, what is 
more, without necessarily leading to the increase of the value of the 
products, is, together with the growth of the amount of capital and 
of the population, the essential characteristic of economic progress, 
and that in making this truth apparent, economic theory throws no 
less light on social economics than it throws, in other respects, on 
applied economics.

Notes
i By this term, Walras denoted the increase of this year’s production of com-
modities and capital goods in comparison with that of the preceding year.
ii In the previous section, Walras wrote ‘quantités…de proit de capitaux 
proprement dits’. he reader will remember that proit in Walras’s French 
or ‘proits’ within quotation marks in English is Walras’s term for the ser-
vices of capital goods properly speaking. When we have not put the word 
proit in quotation marks, it is our translation of Walras’s word ‘bénéice’, 
which means revenue minus cost. To use his distracting word ‘proit’ as 
little as possible, we correctly translated the words opening this note as 
‘quantities…of services of capital goods properly speaking’. Walras deined 
‘capitaux’ without qualiication as all three kinds of capital – land, human 
capital, and capital properly speaking. However, repeatedly in this lesson, 


330 heory of capital formation and credit

he wrote simply ‘capitaux’ without qualiication but did not mean it in the 
sense he had deined it. hus, in the example to which this note relates, he 
wrote about the substitution of the ‘proit de capitaux à la rente’, but he was 
referring to capital goods properly speaking. Evidently he felt he did not 
need to add ‘properly speaking’ because he had preceded the words with 
the French word proit, which, to him, means the services of only capital 
goods properly speaking, and because he immediately used the contrasting 
term rente, which, to him, is the services of land; and we followed the same 
reasoning and procedure in our translation. In short, we would have misled 
the reader if we had translated his words ‘proit de capitaux’ literally as ‘the 
services of capital goods’, because he was not referring to all three types of 
capital; but since he did not write ‘capitaux proprement dits’ we could not 
insert the latter three words in the English translation.
iii Below, Walras calls this ‘the production function’.
iv his has to be interpreted as saying: ‘decrease in the raretés of the products 
consumed by individuals, by the people, etc.’

LESSON 29

Critique of the doctrine of the Physiocrats

SUMMARy: – he Tableau économique. he productive class; the 
class of proprietors, the sterile class. he industrial class produces 
all it consumes; it is not unproductive; the Physiocrats are wrong 
to believe that wealth consists only of material goods. he indus-
trial class produces, like the agricultural class, a net product that 
can provide for a class of proprietors. he industrial class makes, 
like the agricultural class, initial capital investments. he Tableau 
économique does not contain a theory of the determination of the 
prices of products and services.
284. he sketch of the economic life of a society we gave in lesson 27 
by means of concrete numbers is called an economic table. here is 
at least one analogous table, the Tableau économique, that is famous 
in the history of economics. hat is Dr. Quesnay’s, ordered by King 
Louis the 15th and printed in 1758 at the palace of Versailles under 
his very eyes. It is the table in which the Physiocratic doctrine was 
summarized. No copy of this publication is known to exist; we can 
ind only an Analyse du Tableau économique in Dupont de Nemours’s 
volume titled Physiocratie, published in 1768, and an ‘Explication 
du Tableau économique à Madame de ***’, by the priest Baudeau 
in the Éphémerides du citoyen of the same year. his ‘Explication’ 
was reprinted separately in 1770. It has been reproduced, with the 
Analyse, in the Collection des principaux économistes published by 
Guillaumin.


332 heory of capital formation and credit

285. he Analyse starts as follows:
he nation is divided into three classes of citizens: the productive class, 
the class of proprietors, and the sterile class.
he productive class is the one that renews, by the cultivation of the land, 
the annual wealth of the nation, that advances the expenses of agricultural 
labor, and that pays the yearly incomes of the owners of the land. he duties 
of this class include all the labor and all the expenditures that have to be 
made until the irst sale of the output: it is through this sale that we know 
the value of the annual production of the wealth of the nation.
he class of proprietors consists of the sovereign, the landowners, and the 
persons having the right to levy certain special taxes in kind.i his class sub-
sists on the income or net product of agriculture, paid to it annually by the 
productive class, ater deducting from this annual reproduction of wealth 
the funds needed for repaying the annual advances, and for the mainten-
ance of the productive resources.
he sterile class is formed by all the citizens that perform other services 
and other labor than that used in agriculture, and whose expenses are paid 
by the productive class and by the class of proprietors, who themselves draw 
their incomes from the productive class.1
To clarify this by means of a concrete example, the Physiocrats 
assumed there is a kingdom with an area of 130 million French acresii 
and 30 million people.
In this country, the productive class, or agricultural class own, 
under the name original advances, 10 billion worth of initial ixed 
capital, and under the name annual advances, 2 billion of circulat-
ing capital. Provided with these funds, they draw from their land 
5 billion of products per year, consisting of 4 billion of foodstuf and 1 
billion of raw materials for industrial purposes. From this they hand 
over 2 billion of foodstuf as income to the class of proprietors; they 
keep 2 billion for themselves to replenish their circulating capital; 
and they give 1 billion of raw material to the sterile class in exchange 
for 1 billion of manufactured products, which constitutes the inter-
est and maintenance of their original advances. To summarize: the  
3 billion worth of agricultural and industrial products that are kept 
by the productive class constitute the revenues of that class.

page 58.


Critique of the doctrine of the Physiocrats 333

he class of proprietors receives annually, as we just have seen, 
2 billion of income in the form of foodstuf from the productive class. 
hey keep 1 billion for themselves, and they exchange the other bil-
lion with the sterile class for manufactured objects.
he sterile class, or industrial class, own, under the name advances, 
as circulating capital, a fund of 1 billion in raw materials. hus pro-
vided, they transform the raw materials into industrial products that 
they divide into three parts: 1 billion that, as was said above, they 
exchange with the productive class for 1 billion of raw materials with 
which they replenish their advances, 1 billion that they exchange 
with the class of owners of property, as also has been said above, 
against 1 billion of foodstuf, and, inally, a third part, on which the 
Physiocrats did not explain themselves clearly, that the proprietors 
apparently retain for themselves, and that apparently must be evalu-
ated at 1 billion like the two other parts.
286. he irst and most important criticism of the Tableau économique 
concerns the conception of the role of the sterile class, namely the 
industrial and commercial class. he Physiocrats repeated many 
times that in calling this class sterile they did not want to say that it is 
useless, but only that it is unproductive in the sense that it consumes 
everything that it produces and leaves no net product. Let us accept 
for a moment that it is true that the industrial and commercial class 
does not leave any product utilizable for the support of a class of pro-
prietors; even then the name would be badly chosen. his class that 
consumes all that it produces, is also a class that produces all that it 
consumes. Why conceal the reality of the facts by saying that they 
neither produce nor consume?
When we try to go discover the reason for this way of thinking of 
the Physiocrats, we recognize that, for them, the idea of wealth was 
essentially linked to the idea of materiality. 4 billion of foodstuf and  
1 billion of industrial raw materials; that was, in their view, the 
amount of wealth, produced, and consumed each year, produced in 
its entirety by the agricultural class, and divided among the three 
classes and consumed by them in the following amounts: 2 billion 
of foodstuf by the agricultural class, 1 billion by the class of pro-
prietors, 1 billion by the industrial class; and raw materials in the 
amount of one third of a billion for each of the three classes. Having 


334 heory of capital formation and credit

this point of view, they had to consider the agricultural class as being 
the productive class par excellence, sustaining the class of proprietors 
and the industrial and commercial class. However, it is precisely this 
point of view that is erroneous.
he name social wealth should be given to everything, material or 
immaterial, that is valuable and that is exchanged; and since, accord-
ing to the Physiocrats themselves, the labor applied to the raw mater-
ial by the industrial class makes possible that these raw materials, 
purchased for 1 billion, are resold for 3 billion, we can say that this 
so-called sterile class produces and consumes annually 2 billion of 
social wealth: it produces 2 billion of labor, and consumes 1 billion of 
agricultural products and 1 billion of industrial products. From this 
follows that the total annual production in this country is in reality  
7 billion and not 5 billion.
287. Let us now go further. Is it true that the industrial and commer-
cial class produces exclusively what it consumes or consumes entirely 
what it produces, without leaving a net product that can be used as 
income for the class of proprietors? Not at all. Industry and com-
merce do not use the land in the same way as agriculture does, but 
they nevertheless make a certain use of it. one cannot practice indus-
try or commerce somewhere between heaven and earth; it must be 
undertaken somewhere on terra irma. Now, just as agriculture can 
sustain, by means of landed income, the class of proprietors that lives 
in the countryside, industry and commerce can similarly sustain by 
means of landed income the class of proprietors that lives in the cit-
ies. So, why did the Physiocrats not identify this income from the 
land in the cities, which is a real net product of industry and com-
merce? obviously because it is an immaterial income.
288. his is therefore a irst point regarding the similarity between the 
industrial class and the agricultural class. Here is another. Quesnay 
endows his productive class with two kinds of capital: an original 
endowment of ixed capital, and annual advances of circulating cap-
ital, but he gives the sterile class only advances in raw materials. Why 
is this? Is the loom less indispensable to the industrialist than the 
plow to the farmer? Is the workshop less necessary for the former 
than the barn for the latter? No, of course not; but because the service 


Critique of the doctrine of the Physiocrats 335

of the plow transforms itself into wheat, which is a material thing, 
whereas the service of the loom transforms itself in a manner that 
is immaterial, identiication of the existence of the latter service was 
forgotten.iii
289. If we introduce this point of view of immaterial production, 
with all its consequences, into the doctrine of the Physiocrats, we 
see without diiculty how we could arrive, from their conception of 
the three classes, the productive class, the class of proprietors, and 
the sterile class, at our own conception of the three categories, land-
owners, workers, and capitalists. However, this having been done, we 
must still introduce agricultural, industrial, and commercial entre-
preneurs, the markets of products, the market for services, etc., etc., 
in order to have a system of economic theory that is suiciently com-
plete and satisfactory.
here is, indeed, another very serious fault in the Physiocratic 
doctrine that we have to point out: namely that they do not actually 
furnish any theory of prices, whether of the prices of products, or 
of the prices of services. Neither Quesnay, nor his disciples, explain 
how the incomes of the productive class and the sterile class, and 
the net product constituting the income of the class of proprietors, 
are determined. hat determination remains completely arbitrary in 
the Tableau économique. he Physiocrats have been wrongly criti-
cized for their use of concrete numbers to make their theory more 
comprehensible. It is certain, however, that they have mixed up the 
quantities they were free to choose arbitrarily with those that they 
needed to deduce from the former; in a word, they have mixed up 
the data and the unknowns of the problem. he Tableau économique 
does not contain a theory of the determination of rent, nor of wages, 
nor of interest. In a complete treatise, there must, in particular, be an 
examination of these three points, and most notably of the question 
of whether the net product is or is not the interest yielded by the 
advances in agriculture. Likewise, there should be a critique of the 
Physiocratic ideas about the circulating capital of the productive and 
sterile classes, as well as of their ideas on the role of money. We would 
thus be led to reproach them for quite a number of imperfections, 
which did not, however, prevent them from being not only the irst, 
but also the only school of economists that, in France, had an theory 


336 heory of capital formation and credit

of economics that is original and in which, amidst its errors, appear 
insights of an extraordinary profoundness and accuracy.

Notes
i he French word Walras used for such a person is ‘décimateur’. he déci-
mateurs had the right to levy the so-called ‘dîme’, a tax in kind during the 
Ancien Régime, levied by the Church on agricultural products. he tax is 
more or less comparable to the tithes in England. Walras uses the word 
‘décimateur’ to indicate such a person.
ii Walras used the word ‘arpent’. he ‘arpent’ of the Ancien Régime measured 
5,107 square meters, about half a hectare.
iii Walras meant that the loom does not produce a new thing, but only changes 
the way the yarn is treated; that is, it is made into cloth.

LESSON 30

Exposition and refutation of the English 
theory of the prices of products

SUMMARy: – Fundamental distinction between products the 
quantity of which cannot be increased, and those the quantity 
of which can be increased without limit. here are no products 
the quantity of which can be increased without limit. here is no 
amount of the expenses of production that can determine the 
price of the products. Reaction of the price of productive services 
on the price of the products: the case of services that do not exist 
any longer; the case of speciic services; the case of nonspeciic 
services. he two latter cases are not opposites. A third category of 
products: confusion between immediate multiplication and pro-
gressive multiplication.
290. To arrive at a theory of rent, wages, and interest, the English 
School has made eforts that have been much more widely followed 
and are much more serious than those of the various schools that, 
in France, have succeeded the Physiocrats, and the critical study of 
those eforts is absolutely necessary. We will devote this and the fol-
lowing two lessons to it.
Ricardo wrote
here are some commodities, the value of which is determined by their 
scarcity alone. No labour can increase the quantity of such goods, and there-
fore their value cannot be lowered by an increased supply. Some rare statues 
and pictures, scarce books and coins, wines of a peculiar quality, which can be 
made only from grapes grown on a particular soil, of which there is a very lim-
ited quantity, are all of this description. heir value is wholly independent of 
the quantity of labour originally necessary to produce them, and varies with the 
varying wealth and inclinations of those who are desirous to possess them.


338 heory of capital formation and credit

hese commodities, however, form a very small part of the mass of com-
modities daily exchanged in the market. By far the greatest part of those 
goods which are the objects of desire, are procured by labour; and they may 
be multiplied, not in one country alone, but in many, almost without any 
assignable limit, if we are disposed to bestow the labour necessary to obtain 
them.1
It is quite remarkable, and it shows more than anything else the 
steady and continuous development and the persistence of the doc-
trine of the English School, that J.S. Mill, half a century ater Ricardo, 
expresses himself in exactly the same terms.
here are things of which it is physically impossible to increase the quantity 
beyond certain narrow limits. Such are those wines which can be grown 
only in peculiar circumstances of soil, climate, and exposure. Such also are 
ancient sculptures; pictures by old masters; rare books or coins, or other 
articles of antiquarian curiosity. Among such may also be reckoned houses 
and building-ground, in a town of deinite extent (such as Venice, or any 
fortiied town where fortiications are necessary to security); the most 
desirable sites in any town whatever; houses and parks peculiarly favoured 
by natural beauty, in places where that advantage is uncommon. Potentially, 
all land whatever is a commodity of this class; and might be practically so in 
countries fully occupied and cultivated.
But there is another category (embracing the majority of all things that 
are bought and sold), in which the obstacle to attainment consists only in 
the labour and expense requisite to produce the commodity. Without a cer-
tain labour and expense it cannot be had: but when any one is willing to 
incur these, there needs be no limit to the multiplication of the product.2
his fundamental distinction can, as can be seen, be reduced to a 
division of products into two categories: a small number of products 
the quantity of which cannot be increased, and a large number of 
products that can be multiplied without limit. Having posited this, 
and leaving the irst category aside in order to deal exclusively with 
the second, the English economists declare that, concerning this cat-
egory, the amount of expenses of production determines the price of

he English theory of the prices of products 339

the products. If they had restricted themselves to dividing the prod-
ucts into two categories, and to stating, regarding the second type of 
goods, that their price tends to equality with the amount of expenses 
of production under the regime of free competition, there would 
be nothing more to say about it; but to say that the products of the 
second category can be multiplied without limit, and that there is, for 
these goods, a certain amount of expenses of production that deter-
mines their price, those are two errors that it is essential to refute.
291. here are no products that can be multiplied without limit. All 
the things that form part of social wealth: land, personal faculties, 
capital goods properly speaking, income of any kind, exist only in 
limited quantities. Among those things, land and personal faculties 
are natural wealth; capital goods properly speaking and incomes 
are artiicial wealth; they are products that have passed through the 
mechanism of production. In some of them, land services predom-
inate: this is the case with respect to fruits or wild animals, surface 
ores, and mineral water. In some other products, it is labor: this is the 
case with respect to lawyers’ or doctors’ consultations, to professors’ 
lectures, to singing and dancing. In most cases, land services, labor, 
and ‘proits’ will be used all together. From this follows that all things 
that belong to social wealth are either land, or personal faculties, or 
products of land services and of the labor of personal faculties. Well, 
Mill admits that land exists only in limited quantity; if we make him 
observe that the same is the case with respect to personal faculties, 
how could he continue to maintain that products can be multiplied 
without limit?
292. Nor is there an amount of expenses of production that, itself 
being determinate, consequently determines the price of the prod-
ucts. he price of the products is determined on the market for prod-
ucts as a function of their utility and their quantity; there is no need 
to consider other conditions; they are necessary and suicient. It does 
not matter whether the products have cost more or less than their 
price. If they have cost more, too bad for the entrepreneurs: they suf-
fer a loss; if they have cost less, so much the better for the entrepre-
neurs: they make a proit. Far from it being true that it is the average 
cost of the products in terms of productive services that determines 


340 heory of capital formation and credit

their price, it is rather their price that determines their average cost 
in terms of productive services. Indeed, the price of the productive 
services is determined in the market for services as a function of the 
supply by the landowners, the workers, and the capitalists, and the 
demand for the services by the entrepreneurs. And this demand, on 
what does it depend? Precisely, on the prices of the products. With 
respect to the products whose average cost is more than the price, the 
entrepreneurs reduce their demand for productive services, and the 
price of these services decreases. With respect to the products whose 
average cost is less, the demand by the entrepreneurs is increased, 
and the price of the productive services increases. Such is the inter-
linked character of the phenomena, and it is inaccurate to conceive 
of it in another way.
293. Now, can there not be a reaction of the price of productive ser-
vices on the price of the products? yes, undoubtedly, but only by a 
reaction on their quantity. And to study this reaction on the price 
we must divide the various possible cases into groups according 
to the ease or the diiculty of their reaction on the quantity of the 
products.
First, there is the case of the productive services that no longer 
exist: – ‘[R]are statues and pictures, scarce books and coins’, men-
tioned by Ricardo [p. 6]; – ‘[A]ncient sculptures; pictures by old mas-
ters; rare books or coins, or other articles of antiquarian curiosity’, 
Mill said [III, II, § 2]. he productive services no longer existing in 
these cases, we cannot say that they have any value and that their 
value can react on the quantity and the value of the products. Even 
according to Ricardo and Mill, the value of these products therefore 
results exclusively from the law of supply and demand.
294. hen there is the case of special productive services: – Ricardo’s 
‘wines of an exquisite quality, which can be made only from grapes 
grown on a particular soil, of which there is a very limited quantity’ 
[p. 6]; Mill’s ‘wines which can be grown only in peculiar circumstances 
of soil, climate, and exposure’, and his ‘houses and building-ground, 
in a town of deinite extent (such as Venice, or any fortiied town 
where fortiications are necessary to security); the most desirable 
sites in any town whatever; houses and parks peculiarly favored by 


he English theory of the prices of products 341

natural beauty, in places where that advantage is uncommon’ [III, II, 
§ 2]. What do we discover when we look closely into this case? he 
productive services are still existing; they are not monopolized; that 
is to say, they are not owned by a single person, but they are speciic 
to the products. other lands can yield other fruit, but not grapes, or 
if so, not the same kind of grapes. other land can be used for houses 
or parks, but not houses and parks with the same views. hat is why 
these productive services are not afraid of competition. An increase 
in their price cannot attract similar services because similar services 
do not exist. When the price of the products increases, the price of 
the productive services will rise accordingly, without any possible 
reaction on the quantity and the price of the products. Had Ricardo’s 
and Mill’s classiication been a little more systematic, they would have 
cited some examples of personal services no less specialized than the 
land services they mentioned: those of living artists, singers, eminent 
doctors and surgeons. But let us now, at last, consider the case they 
have in mind.
295. his is the case of productive services that are not specialized. 
his is, it is true, the most frequent case. here are certain product-
ive services that do not have speciic applicability, and these are the 
most numerous. With respect to these productive services, it suices 
to see what happens in the examples referred to by Ricardo and Mill, 
and in examples that can be added to theirs. Alongside the land that 
produces grapes of exceptional quality, there is land that produces 
grapes of standard quality. Alongside the land used for the produc-
tion of wine, there is land used for the production of wheat, forage, 
and vegetables. Now, land producing wheat can also produce bar-
ley, hops, clover, or rape; land producing cabbage can also produce 
lettuce. We must therefore observe that some speciicity will always 
be found, within wider limits but nevertheless within certain lim-
its: wheat needs the soil of plains, dry and light; forage needs valley 
land, dense and humid. But it is above all for labor that being spe-
cialized is perhaps the exceptional case, and being unspecialized the 
normal case. Alongside the man who has a tenor voice or the legs 
of an acrobat, the eyes of a painter, or the ear of a musician, there is 
a crowd of people able to do the most diverse things because they 
are less capable of doing this or that particular task. A man who has 


342 heory of capital formation and credit

been educated to be a lawyer would oten have also been able to be 
an administrator; but certainly a man who has become a carpenter 
could undoubtedly have also been able to be a locksmith. What do 
most people want information about when choosing a profession? 
Precisely the amount of the wages that can be earned in it; that is to 
say, the value of the productive services in that profession. herefore, 
there are unspecialized services that, contrary to the specialized pro-
ductive services, have reason to fear competitors. An increase in the 
prices of the unspecialized productive services can attract into the 
productive activity other similar productive services that exist in 
more or less considerable amounts. When the price of the products 
increases, the price of the productive services will increase, but only 
temporarily; for there will be an increase in the quantity of product-
ive services and an increase in the quantity of products. only a lesser 
increase in the price of the productive services in general and of the 
products in general will remain. We could argue similarly in the case 
of a decrease, instead of an increase, in the price of the unspecialized 
productive services.
296. Hence, in reality, the two cases distinguished by Ricardo and 
Mill are not completely opposites. In both cases, there is a natural 
tendency for the price of the products and the price of the product-
ive services to be related. In both cases, an increase or decrease of 
the quantities of the products causes an increase or decrease in the 
quantities of the productive services. However, in the irst case, the 
increase or decrease in the price of the productive services is a ter-
minal result, without reaction on the price and the quantity of the 
products. In the second case, on the contrary, the increase or decrease 
of the productive services that results from the original increase or 
decrease of the products is a temporary occurrence that has as a irst 
consequence an inlow or outlow of similar productive services, and 
has as a permanent consequence a general rise or fall in the price of 
productive services of the same kind and a rise or fall equally gen-
eral, although smaller than the original rise or fall, in the price of 
all the products in the production of which these services compete. 
What the increase or decrease loses in intensity, it gains in its extent. 
Neither in the one case, nor in the other, is the price of the products 
determined by the amount of their expenses of production. And, 


he English theory of the prices of products 343

above all, neither in the one, nor in the other case, is there anything 
that looks like Ricardo’s multiplication ‘almost without any assignable 
limit’i or Mill’s ‘no limit to the multiplication’.ii Ater having intro-
duced his irst category, Mill adds: ‘Potentially, all land whatever is a 
commodity of this class.’iii Undoubtedly; and, moreover, virtually all 
personal faculties could also be classiied in that way. But ater that, 
what remains in the second category? Nothing. hus the fundamen-
tal distinction of the English school has none of the validity that its 
authors attribute to it.
297. Mill continues:
here is a third case, intermediate between the two preceding, and rather 
more complex, which I shall at present merely indicate, but the importance 
of which in political economy is extremely great. here are commodities 
which can be multiplied to an indeinite extent by labour and expenditure, 
but not by a ixed amount of labour and expenditure. only a limited quan-
tity can be produced at a given cost: if more is wanted, it must be produced 
at a greater cost. To this class, as has been oten repeated, agricultural prod-
uce belongs; and generally all the rude produce of the earth.3
Here, without informing us, and without being aware of it, the 
author ends his considerations of the case of the multiplication of 
the products at a given time and with a given quantity of product-
ive services, and begins to consider the case of the multiplication of 
products from period to period and by means of a growing quantity 
of productive services. And it is the circumstance that, among all 
the productive services, land services cannot be increased in quantity 
that leads him to form his third category of things: ‘agricultural prod-
uce … and generally all the rude produce of the earth’. In proceeding 
in this way, the famous logician, following his habitual procedure,

LESSON 31

Exposition and refutation of the English 
theory of rent

SUMMARy: – ‘he rent which any land will yield, is the excess of 
its produce beyond what would be returned to the same capital if 
employed on the worst land in cultivation. Rent is also the dife-
rence between the income from a capital and the capital employed 
in the most unfavorable circumstances.’ Geometrical presen-
tation of the theory: areas showing the net product of diferent 
land; areas showing the net product of the same land. Having the 
character of ininitesimals: curves of net product and of the rate of 
proit. Algebraic expression: the net product function and the rate 
of proit function.
‘he rent is the excess of the net product over interest.’ 
Composition of the net product. Composition of the capital used. 
Rectiication of the theory: ‘he rent is the excess of the net prod-
ucts over the wages and interest.’ he English doctrine, saying that 
total products is a non-proportionally increasing function of cap-
ital used expressed in numeraire, assumes, without motivation, 
that the prices of personal services and movable capital services 
are predetermined and constant; this hypothesis implies increas-
ing prices of the products. Moreover, the unwarranted assumption 
is made that only one type of land services is needed for the manu-
facture of the products.
298. he theory of land services or of rent of the English School is 
a theory presented for the irst time, it seems, at the end of the last 
century by Dr Anderson,i expounded again at the beginning of this 
century by Sir Edward Westii and by Malthus,iii popularized by, in 
particular, Ricardo, whose name it bears, clariied by James Milliv 


346 heory of capital formation and credit

and by McCulloch,v reproduced by John Stuart Mill, and still taught 
nowadays by almost all English economists. Here is how Ricardo 
presented it:
hus suppose land – No. 1, 2, 3, – to yield, with an equal employment of 
capital and labour, a net produce of 100, 90, and 80 quarters of corn. In a 
new country, where there is an abundance of fertile land compared with the 
population, and where therefore it is only necessary to cultivate No. 1, the 
whole net produce will belong to the cultivator, and will be the proits of the 
stock which he advances. As soon as population had so far increased as to 
make it necessary to cultivate No. 2, from which ninety quarters only can 
be obtained ater supporting the labourers, rent would commence on No. 
1; for either there must be two rates of proit on agricultural capital, or ten 
quarters, or the value of ten quarters must be withdrawn from the produce 
of No. 1, for some other purpose. Whether the proprietor of the land, or 
any other person, cultivated No. 1, these ten quarters would equally consti-
tute rent; for the cultivator of No. 2 would get the same result with his cap-
ital, whether he cultivated No. 1, paying ten quarters for rent, or continued 
to cultivate No. 2, paying no rent. In the same manner it might be shown 
that when No. 3 is brought into cultivation, the rent of No. 2 must be ten 
quarters, or the value of ten quarters, whilst the rent of No. 1 would rise 
to twenty quarters; for the cultivator of No. 3 would have the same proits 
whether he paid twenty quarters for the rent of No. 1, ten quarters for the 
rent of No. 2, or cultivated No. 3 free of all rent.1
hat is a irst part of the demonstration that J.S. Mill formulated 
in this theorem: – Rent is the diference between the income of the 
land that produces it and that of the worst land in cultivation.2,vi 
However, in Ricardo’s work the theory is immediately completed in 
the following way:
299. It oten, and, indeed, commonly happens, that before No. 2, 3, 4, or 
5, or the inferior lands are cultivated, capital can be employed more pro-
ductively on those lands which are already in cultivation. It may perhaps be 
found, that by doubling the original capital employed on No. 1, though the 
produce will not be doubled, will not be increased by 100 quarters, it may 
be increased by eighty-ive quarters, and that this quantity exceeds what 
could be obtained by employing the same capital, on land No. 3.

1 [David] Ricardo, he Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. [hird edi-
tion, 1821. Reprint, London, J. M. Dent and Sons, 1948, ch. II, pp. 35–6].
2 J.S. Mill, Principles d’economie politique; Book II, ch. XVI, § 3.


he English theory of rent 347

In such case, capital will be preferably employed on the old land, and 
will equally create a rent; for rent is always the diference between the 
produce obtained by the employment of two equal quantities of capital and 
labour. If, with a capital of £1,000, a tenant obtain 100 quarters of wheat 
from his land, and by the employment of a second capital of £1,000, he 
obtain a further return of eighty-ive, his landlord would have the power 
at the expiration of his lease, of obliging him to pay iteen quarters, or an 
equivalent value, for additional rent; for there cannot be two rates of proit. 
If he is satisied with a diminution of iteen quarters in the return for his 
second £1,000, it is because no employment more proitable can be found 
for it. he common rate of proit would be in that proportion, and if the 
original tenant refused, some other person would be found willing to give 
all which exceeded that rate of proit to the owner of the land from which 
he derived it.
In this case, as well as in the other, the capital last employed pays no rent. 
For the greater productive powers of the irst £1,000, iteen quarters is paid 
for rent, for the employment of the second £1,000 no rent whatever is paid. 
If a third £1,000 be employed on the same land, with a return of seventy-
ive quarters, rent will then be paid for the second £1,000, and will be equal 
to the diference between the produce of these two, or ten quarters; and at 
the same time the rent of the irst £1,000 will rise from iteen to twenty-ive 
quarters; while the last £1,000 will pay no rent whatever.3
hat is the second part of Ricardo’s demonstration, also formu-
lated by J.S. Mill in this second theorem: – Rent is also the diference 
between the income that a capital investment yields and the income of 
a similar capital employed in the most unfavorable circumstances.4,vii
300. his theory is a mathematical theory that must be expressed 
in mathematics before discussing it; for this is the only way to 
grasp it.
Let there be, therefore, two coordinate axes: a horizontal axis 
ox (Fig. 25) and three vertical axes oy. on the horizontal axis, we 
measure, starting in point o, lengths ox1′, ox′2 , and ox′3 correspond-
ing to equal employments of capital on, respectively, lands 1, 2, and 3, 
employments regarding which Ricardo does not explicitly say, in the 

3 [David] Ricardo, he Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, ch. II, 
[pp. 36–7].

irst part of his demonstration, how they are evaluated nor what is 
their value, but that he assumes, in the second part of his demonstra-
tion, on the contrary, to be explicitly evaluated in terms of numeraire 
and that their value is £1,000. on the vertical axes, we measure, 
starting at the points o, the lengths, Οt1 , Οt2 , and Οt3 such that 
we will have three rectangles, Οt1y1′x1′, Οt2 y′2 x′2 and, Οt3y′3x′3 , with 
these lengths as height and the lengths Οx1′, Οx′2 , and Οx′3 as basis; 
the areas of these rectangles represent quantities corresponding to 
the net products of the lands 1, 2, and 3, that Ricardo assumes are 
evaluated in units of products amounting to 100, 90, and 80 quar-
ters. Having said this, the irst part of his demonstration amounts 
to saying that, because there cannot be two diferent proit rates in 
agriculture, when land no 2 has to be cultivated, there will be paid, 
for the lease of land no 1, a rent equal to the diference of the areas 
of the irst two rectangles, namely the area At1y1′B corresponding to 
10 quarters; and, when land no 3 has to be cultivated, there will be

paid, for the lease of land no 1, a rent equal to the diference of the 
areas of the irst rectangle and the third one, namely the area Ct1y1′D 
corresponding to 20 quarters; and there must be paid, for the lease 
of land no 2, a rent equal to the diference of the areas of the second 
rectangle and the third one, namely the area Et2 y′2F corresponding 
to 10 quarters, no rent being paid for the lease of land no 3.
301. Now (Fig. 26), starting from the point o, let us also measure on the 
horizontal axis, extending the length ox1′ , lengths x1′x1′′ and x1′′x′1′′ 
corresponding to employments of £1,000 of capital, successively invested 
in land no 1. on the parallels x1′y1′ and x1′′ y1′′ to the vertical axis, going 
through the points x1′ and x1′′ we measure, starting at these points, the 
lengths, x1′t1′ and x1′′ t1′′ such that we will have two rectangles, x1′t1′y1′′x1′′ 
and x1′′ t1′′y1′′′x1′′′ with these lengths as height and the lengths x1′x1′′ 
and x1′′x′1′′ as bases; the areas of these rectangles represent quantities 
corresponding to the net products of the successive employments of

amounts of land no 1, evaluated as before in units of products amount-
ing to 85 and 75 quarters. Having posited this, the second part of his 
demonstration amounts to saying that, because there cannot be two dif-
ferent proit rates in agriculture, when a second employment of £1,000 
of capital has to be made on land no 1, ater having taken into use land 
no 2 but before land no 3 has been taken into use, there must be paid, 
because of the use of the irst capital outlay of £1,000, a rent equal to the 
diference of the two rectangles ot1y1′x1′ and x1′t1′y1′′x1′′, namely the area 
Lt1y1′t1′ corresponding to 15 quarters; and, when one has to use a third 
capital outlay of £1,000 on land no 1, there must be paid, because of the 
use of the irst capital outlay of £1,000, a rent equal to the diference of 
the two rectangles ot1y1′x1′ and x1′′t1′′y1′′′x1′′′ , namely the area Mt1y1′N, 
corresponding to 25 quarters; and, because of the use of the second cap-
ital outlay of £1,000, there must be paid a rent equal to the diference 
of the two rectangles x1′t1′y1′′x1′′ and x1′′t1′′y1′′′x1′′′namely the area Nt1′y1′′t1′′, 
corresponding to 10 quarters; thus, all in all, there will be paid for 
the lease of land n° 1 a rent represented by the two areas Mt1y1′N 
and Nt1′y1′′t1′′, namely by the area Mt1y1′t1′y1′′t1′′ corresponding to 35 
quarters.
302. However, once the theory is thus put into mathematical form, one 
thing makes itself immediately apparent: namely that what Ricardo 
says about equal employments of capital successively used either on 
diferent land, or on the same land must be said, be it true or not, not 
only of employments of £1,000, but likewise of employments of £100, 
employments of £10, employments of £1; in short, if the rate of pro-
duction is, for each piece of land, a decreasing function of the amount 
of capital employed, there is no reason not to assume that if capital 
increases by an ininitely small quantity, the rate of production must 
decrease by an ininitely small quantity. of course, matters may be 
otherwise; however, until we have been shown that this last case is 
the general case or the exception, not by arbitrary assumptions but by 
observations drawn from experience, we are entitled to use the former 
case in our theoretical reasoning. Consequently, to represent the fact of 
the decrease in question, we must substitute the discontinuous curves 
such as t1y1′t1′y1′′t1′′y1′′′ by the continuous curves T1T1′, T2T2′, T3T3′,  


he English theory of rent 351

(Fig. 27), constructed such that, the capital used on land n° 1 being rep-
resented by the length ox1, the net product in units of product is rep-
resented by the area oT1y1x1; that, the capital used on land n° 2 being 
represented by the length ox2 , the net product in units of product is 
represented by the area oT2 y2 x2 ; and so forth. hen, the observation 
that there cannot be two diferent proit rates of capital in agriculture 
will require that the areas of the rectangles oPy1x1 and oQy2 x2, rep-
resenting in terms of units of product the proits in question on land 
no 1, no 2,  are proportional to their bases ox1, ox2, , or, putting it 
otherwise, the heights x1 y1, x2 y2 ,  representing the rate of proit in 
terms of units of product, that is to say, the rate of production, must be 
equal. And, consequently, the portions of the areas PT1y1, QT2 y2,  
that are above the horizontal line PQR represent, in terms of units of 
product, the rents of the lands no 1 and no 2, whereas the land no 3 does 
not yield any rent, because, as assumed in our igure, the horizontal 
line PQR does not meet the curve T3T3′.

303. Algebraically, let h1,h2 ,h3 , be the amounts of net product of 
land no 1, no 2, no 3, , or the excesses of the total quantity of units of 
product over the quantity of these units necessary to pay the wages; 
let x1, x2 , x3 , be the amounts in numeraire of the capital goods 
used; t be the rate of interest expressed in units of product. he rents 
r1,r2 ,r3 ,, expressed in the same way, are then furnished, according 
to the English doctrine, by
r1 = h1 − x1t, r2 = h2 − x2t, r3 = h3 − x3t, [1]
Between the net products and the capital goods used there is the 
relation
h1 = F1 (x1 ), h2 = F2 (x2 ), h3 = F3 (x3 ), [2]
and if we deine
φ1 (x) = F1′(x), φ2 (x) = F2′(x), φ3 (x) = F3′(x),,
there are between the rate of interest and the capital goods used the 
relations
t = φ1 (x1 ) = φ2 (x2 ) = φ3 (x3 ) =  [3]
hese two kinds of relations are also represented by curves like T1T1′, 
T2T2′, T3T3′ ,  in which the variable x corresponds to the abscissa, 
the function t to the ordinates, and the function h to the areas.
Attentive inspection of the above equations makes it clear that, for 
m pieces of land, there are 3m + 1 unknowns and only 3m equations. 
Another equation is needed. Interpreting as faithfully as possible 
Ricardo’s theory and conforming to the preceding analogues (§§ 117, 
197, 239), we can posit the following:
x1 + x2 + x3 + = X. [4]
According to Ricardo, it appears that there is, in a country, a certain 
amount of capital, always increasing, with which one can obtain a 


he English theory of rent 353

quantity of output always increasing, although not proportionally, 
so as to feed an always increasing population. his capital is deter-
minate at a given moment; we call it X, and we allocate it among the 
various types of land such that the rate of production is the same for 
all the pieces of land.
he equations [3], assumed to be solved for x, take the form
x1 = ψ1 (t), x2 = ψ2 (t), x3 = ψ3 (t),,
and t is then given by the modiied equation [4]
ψ1 (t) + ψ2 (t) + ψ3 (t) + = X.
t being determined, x1, x2 , x3 , are determined by means of the 
modiied equations [3]. he lands for which ϕ(0)< t are not culti-
vated; only those for which ϕ(0) > t are. x1, x2 , x3 , being deter-
mined, h1,h2 ,h3 , can be found by means of equations [2]. And 
then r1,r2 ,r3 , are determined by equations [1]. Hence, in the last 
analysis, rent depends on the capital of a country and is determined 
independently of wages and interest as well as of the prices of the 
products. hat is the essence of the English theory of rent.
304. he necessity of presenting Ricardo’s reasoning in terms of 
ininitesimals is so evident that, albeit without ceasing to discuss 
it in ordinary language, certain authors have done so, showing that 
the deinitive form we have given it is certainly the true form of the 
English theory of rent. herefore, we will adhere to it in the discus-
sion, without giving attention to the imperfections in its explication 
or deduction resulting, in Ricardo’s and Mill’s work, from the use 
of a rudimentary form; without, for example, showing how Mill’s 
irst theorem, which assumes essentially that cultivated land of the 
worst quality does not yield rent, is basically incorrect, and, more-
over, in formal contradiction with the second theorem. his error 
disappears, indeed, in the mathematical theory; and the simple 
inspection of the igure shows that the worst land cultivated yields 
a rent, at least in general and apart from the exceptional case of a 
discontinuous production curve that would be intersected precisely 


354 heory of capital formation and credit

at its starting point by the horizontal line representing the rate of 
production.
305. Let us again take up the general equation
r = h − xt;
and, following the notation we have frequently used and with which 
the reader must be familiar, let (B) be the product in question, pb 
its price, (T) the type of land on which it is cultivated, H the total 
number of units obtained per hectare, and, consequently, bt = 1

H the 
production coeicient of product (B) for productive service (T), pt 
the rent, and i the rate of net income in numeraire. As we have seen, 
r and t are, respectively, the rent and the rate of interest expressed in 
units of product; they can be replaced by the values p
p

t

b

 and i

pb in the 

equation above, which then becomes
p
p h x

i

p

t

b b

= − .
Let, moreover, (P), (P ′), (P ″),  be the types of personal cap-
ital or persons whose services enter likewise into the manufacture 
of the product (B), let bp ,bp′ ,bp′′ , be the coeicients of produc-
tion, pp , pp′ , pp′′ , the prices of the personal incomes or the wages, 
Pp ,Pp′ ,Pp′′ , the prices of personal capitals in numeraire; the net 
product in units of output, h, as introduced by Ricardo, is exactly 
equal to
H H

− pb (bp pp + bp′ pp + bp′′ pp′′ +),
hence, making abstraction from depreciation and insurance, taking 
account of which would be easy but would make the formula a little 
more complicated, is exactly equal to,


he English theory of rent 355

H Hi

− pb (bpPp + bp′ Pp′ + bp′′ Pp′′ +).
Let, inally, (K), (K′), (K″),  be the types of movable capital or 
capital goods properly speaking the services of which are used in the 
manufacture of product (B), and bk ,bk′ ,bk′′ , the coeicients of pro-
duction, pk , pk′ , pk′′ , the prices of the services of movable income, 
or proit, and Pp ,Pp′ ,Pp′′ , the prices of the capital in numeraire. he 
amount in numeraire of capital used, x, as introduced by Ricardo, is 
exactly equal to
H (bk Pk + bp′ Pp′ + bp′′ Pp′′ +),
hence, abstraction made from depreciation and insurance, is exactly 
equal to
H
i (bk pk + bk′ pk′ + bk′′ pk′′ +).
306. Now, having said this, there is obviously a preliminary correc-
tion that we may justiiably make to the equation that we want to dis-
cuss, without touching on Ricardo’s theory otherwise than to give it 
the greatest possible exactitude: that is, to bring the prices of the per-
sons (P), (P′), (P ″),  and those of the capital goods properly speak-
ing (K), (K′), (K″),  together in order to get the total use of capital, 
either movable or personal, into the term x; for it is certain that there 
is only one wage rate, as there is only one rate of interest, and that, 
moreover this wage rate is exactly equal to the interest rate, so that 
in our theory we can and must reason at the same time in terms 
of the one and of the other, as has been done also by some English 
economists. his rectiication having been made, the net product h is 
subsumed within the total product H, and the capital used becomes

and that will be represented, the one, by the areas and, the other, 
by the abscissa of the curves TT. And now, having transformed the 
indeterminate function F(x) into a determinate function, nothing is 
easier than inding out whether the term H is a non-proportionally 
increasing function of the term x, hence, in other words, whether the 
curves TT are decreasing. Indeed, solving the value of H from the 
latter equations, we will have

Now, it is a fact of experience that, by associating increasing 
amounts of personal services and movable capital good services 
with landed capital, proportionally increasing quantities of product 
are not obtained; if so, we could obtain from a hectare of land, or 
even from a smaller area, an indeinite quantity of products by apply-
ing an indeinite amount of personal services and movable capital 
good services. Hence, in exact terms, we may say, as we did before 
(§ 274), that the bp ,bp′ ,bp′′ ,, bk ,bk′ ,bk′′ , are not constant magni-
tudes, but decreasing functions of bt ; that is to say, increasing func-
tions of H. But Ricardo and the English economists say quite another 
thing. hey say that by employing increasing amounts of personal 
services and movable capital good services on a piece of land, we 
do not obtain output in quantities that are proportionally increas-
ing; and the employments of capital of which they speak are evalu-
ated in numeraire. To make this assertion identical to the preceding 
one, we must assume that employments that are equal with respect 


he English theory of rent 357

to the quantity of numeraire in which they are expressed are also 
equal with respect to the quantity of personal services and movable 
capital good services that they represent, for otherwise, and if we 
assume that equal quantities of numeraire correspond to more than 
equal quantities of productive services, nothing would stop us from 
conceiving the product as being proportional to the employment of 
capital. In precise terms, in order to be able to say that H is a non-
proportionally increasing function of x, not only at a certain given 
time, but also at diferent times, we must assume that Pp ,Pp′ ,Pp′′ ,, 
Pk ,Pk′ ,Pk′′ ,,i and, consequently, pp , pp′ , pp′′ ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,,i , are 
not only determinate at a certain time, but are also constant from one 
time to another.
If we reread Ricardo’s exposition, we can see that this twofold 
assumption is implicitly in it, if not explicitly, from the beginning 
to end. obviously, Ricardo could not maintain that the product 
obtained depends on the capital used irrespective of the way, how-
ever absurd, in which this employment is applied. Consequently, for 
him, the employments of capital applied, either simultaneously or 
successively, either on the same land or on diferent pieces of land, 
represent certain determinate quantities of certain determinate types 
of capital. hese employments always amount to £1,000; hence the 
prices of capital are determined and constant. However, considering 
everything, the product depends on the nature and the quantity of 
the productive services, and not on the nature and the quantities 
of the capital goods. Accordingly, we must admit that, for Ricardo, 
to the employment of certain determinate quantities of determinate 
types of capital goods there corresponds the employment of certain 
determinate quantities of certain determinate services. he employ-
ments of capital goods always amount to £1,000; if the rate of inter-
est is 5 per cent, the employment of the services will always be £50; 
hence the prices of the services are determinate and constant.
308. his hypothesis has serious consequences, and it is important to 
point them out. It is the one that led Ricardo to base the existence, 
the emergence, and the development of rent on the fact of growing 
expensiveness of products. For him, indeed, it is the average cost that 


358 heory of capital formation and credit

determines the price. on the other hand, as we just saw, the deter-
minate and constant expenditure necessary to obtain the net product 
amounts to £50. If we must add to the cultivation of land no 1, where 
£50 of expenditure yield 100 quarters of net product, the cultivation 
of land no 2, where £50 of expenditure yield 90 quarters, the aver-
age cost, and, consequently, the price will increase from 50/100 to 
50/90. or, if, in the cultivation of land no 1, we must add to the irst 
expenditure of £50, yielding 100 quarters of net product, another £50 
yielding 85 quarters of net product, the average cost, which is also the 
price, will increase from 50/100 to 50/85. In the mathematical expos-
ition of Ricardo’s theory we presented above, we add the expense of 
wages to the interest cost; but the result is the same. Indeed, the price 
pb of the product is equal to either the ratio of the total cost com-
posed of rent, wages, and interest, pt + xi, to the quantity H of prod-
uct, or the ratio of the cost of rent pt to the rent r in terms of units of 
product, or, inally the ratio of the cost of wages and interest, xi, to 
the wages and interest per unit of product, xt; that is to say, as a result, 
to the ratio i/t. Now, abstraction made of the variations in i, this ratio 
increases indeinitely because of decrease of t, which is the basis of 
the theory. From this it results, all things considered, that the rent in 
terms of numeraire increases for two reasons in the course of time; 
irst, because of the increase r in the number of units of products that 
corresponds to it, and, second, because of the increase of the price pb 
of the product. his consequence has been accurately perceived and 
accepted by Ricardo; it forms the subject of a special note at the end 
of his chapter ‘on Rent’.
309. Hence, the English theory of land services can determine their 
price and demonstrate that it is a surplus value only given the twofold 
condition that it assumes the prices of personal capital and of mov-
able capital goods, the rate of net income, and, as a consequence, the 
prices of personal services and of movable capital good services, to 
be determined and constant. We will see in the twoviii following les-
sons that the English School determines neither wages nor interest; 
but, for the time being, we can grant them the hypothesis of such a 
determination. We cannot, for example, grant the School a priori the 
hypothesis of ixedness of the prices of productive services. From this 
follows that the curves or equations giving the product as a function 


he English theory of rent 359

of the capital used do not have any value for the purpose of compar-
ing rent at diferent instants of time for successive employments of 
capital, or for the purpose of stating the law of variation in rent in 
a progressive society; and they can, at the very most, serve only to 
determine purely and simply the rent at a given instant of time in 
relation to simultaneous employments of capital, or to state the law 
of the establishment of rent. only within these limits can we make 
use of the curves in question. he prices pp , p′p , p′p′,, pk , pk′, pk′′, 
being then assumed to be determined, rent will be determined in 
units of product by the equation
p
p H

t

= − ( p p + p′ p′ + p′′ p′′ ++ k k + k′ k′ + k′′ k′′ +),
and in numeraire by
pt = Hpb − H (bp pp + bp′ pp′ + bp′′ pp′′ ++ bk pk + bk′ pk′ +bk′′ pk′′ +).
So, to sum up, by the introduction of the curves T1T1′, T2T2′, T3T3′ , 
 (an introduction that should be allowed only subject to the pre-
ceding reservation and to another more serious condition that will 
follow), the English School introduces as best as it can, in the general 
problem of the determination of the prices, a number of equations 
equal to that of the unknowns, which are the rents in terms of units 
of product. And the problem thus put theoretically is solved prac-
tically by the competition of the entrepreneurs. Having done this, it 
remains to determine, on the other hand, these unknowns: wages, the 
remuneration of the capital services, and the rate of interest, in terms 
of numeraire. Ater that, the rate of production will be determined, 
as has been said above (§ 303), in relation to the amount of capital 
that is available; the price of the products will be determined by the 
ratio of the rate of net income to the rate of production, and, inally, 
the rent in terms of numeraire can be determined by multiplying the 
rent in terms of units of product by the price of the products. Hence, 
in this way, the English School would have succeeded well in estab-
lishing that rent does not form part of the expenses of production, if 
there were not a last diiculty that we have to point out and because 
of which its theory of rent will deinitively fail.

310. Replacing H by 1

bt , multiplying by bt, and transposing the quan-
tity between parentheses in the irst member of the above equation, 
we have
bt pt + bp pp + bp′ pp′ + bp′′ pp′′ ++ bk pk + bk′ pk′ + bk′′ pk′′ + = pb ;
this equation is none other than the equation of the average cost of 
product (B) as it appears in system [4] of our equations of production 
(§ 199), with this restriction that, where there appear several types of 
services of personal faculties (P), (P′), (P″), , and several types of 
services of capital goods properly speaking (K), (K′), (K″), , there 
appears only one type of land service (T). hus, the English the-
ory of rent rests still on the hypothesis that there never enters more 
than a single type of land service in making the products. Now, this 
hypothesis is incorrect with respect to agricultural products as well 
as with respect to industrial products. Wheat, serving as an example 
in Ricardo’s work, does not it into the hypothesis, because in the 
production of wheat a raw material is used, namely manure fertilizer 
coming from cattle fed on meadows that are land of type other than 
the land for growing wheat. For this reason, and also for the reason, 
as we will see below, that the English School does not determine dir-
ectly either wages or interest, we must complete the equation of the 
average cost of product (B) as follows:
b p b p b p b p b p b p
b p b p

 + 
bbk′′ pk′′ + = pb ,
and then join it to the other equations of production to determine at 
the same time, as we have done, the prices of the products and those 
of the productive services. he production functions will serve to 
determine the coeicients of production. herefore, all that remains 
of Ricardo’s theory, ater a rigorous critique, is that rent is not a part 
but a result of the price of products. he same thing can be said of 
wages and interest. Hence, rents, wages, interest, the prices of the 
products, and the coeicients of production are the unknowns of one 
and the same problem and they must be determined together and 
not independently of one another.

measured by the excess of the return to the whole capital employed on 
it, above what is necessary to replace the capital with the ordinary rate of 
proit, or in other words, above what the same capital would yield if it were 
all employed in as disadvantageous circumstances as the least productive 
portion of it.’ Similarly to what he did above, Walras simply copied the 
French one-sentence summary of the relevant section. In our opinion, Jafé

LESSON 32

Exposition and refutation of the English 
theories of wages and interest

SUMMARy: – ‘To purchase produce is not to sustaini [alimenter]ii 
labour.’ Ambiguity of the word sustain: it is desired to prove that 
to purchase the product does not mean to demand labour, and it 
is proven that to purchase the product is not to furnish circulat-
ing capital. ‘Wages depend on the proportion between population 
and capital;’ Rate: average [wage] rate. Capital: circulating capital. 
Population: number of wage earners. Hence the average wage is 
equal to the quotient of the total amount of wages and the total 
number of wage earners. We have only to ind the average wage; 
neither capital nor population are determined.
Confusion between the interest on capital and the proit of the 
entrepreneur. ‘Rent does not really form any part of the expenses 
of production. Proit is the excess of the amount produced over the 
cost of production in terms of wages.’ he English doctrine claims 
in this way to determine two unknowns with a single equation. 
J.-B. Say’s deinitions of wages, interest, and rent. Mr. Boutron’s 
vicious circle. he system of the three markets for services, prod-
ucts, and capital goods constitutes the only scientiic theory of the 
establishment of prices.
311. Concerning the English theory of wages, we refer to John Stuart 
Mill, not because he was the irst to formulate it, but because his dem-
onstration is the most complete one that has been given. his dem-
onstration is constituted, in his work, of two theorems formulated in 
his Principles of Political Economy, one in Book I, Chapter V, § 9: – To 
purchase produce is not to sustain labour; and the other in Book II, 


he English theories of wages and interest 363

Chapter XI, § 1: Wages depend on the proportion between population 
and capital goods. We will examine them successively.
What is striking immediately is the quite singular way of express-
ing the irst of these two theorems. his irst impression is not mis-
leading, and the theorem in question is only a long and fatiguing 
ambiguity. What does this vague and hardly scientiic word sustain 
[alimenter] mean?iii Mill himself explains it to us: ‘To purchase prod-
uce is not to sustain labor,’ means that ‘the demand for labor is con-
stituted by the wages which precede the production, and not by the 
demand which may exist for the commodities resulting from the 
production.’ So, ‘To purchase produce is not to sustain labour’ means 
‘To purchase produce is not to demand labor.’ hen why not state 
the theory in these terms, or rather, instead of this negative formula-
tion, why not use a positive formulation like the one that Mill even-
tually furnishes? hat is what an attentive study of the proposition 
will enable us to learn.
Mill considers a consumer and assumes that he spends his income 
either directly on purchasing services like, for example, having a house 
built, or on buying products like, for example, lace or velvet. hen he 
tells us that these two operations are diferent, and he tries to specify 
in what way they are diferent, in which efort he fails completely. He 
should have compared a man who has a house built with a man who 
buys a inished house, or a man who buys inished lace or velvet with 
a man who has the lace or velvet made; he would then have shown 
us clearly an essential diference between the direct purchase of pro-
ductive services, by means of which a person provides the circulating 
capital needed for the manufacture of the product, and the purchase 
of products, by means of which he only reestablishes this circulating 
capital for a subsequent production. Indeed, dissatisied, it appears, 
with the comparison that he gave us in his text, he presents a second 
one in a footnote.iv A rich individual, A, who spends every day a 
certain amount on wages or on alms that the workers and the poor 
persons spend on ordinary food, passes away, and he is replaced by 
a heir, B, who consumes the wealth himself in the form of delicacies. 
his example, however, is even more incoherent than the irst. he 
author should have distinguished between the case of the alms and 
that of the wages, which are not at all the same; and, in adopting the 
latter case, he should have told us how the labor paid by the wages 


364 heory of capital formation and credit

is employed. If it is work done by gardeners who grow delicacies for 
A, we have simply to do with the distinction between the purchase 
of productive services and the purchase of products, and with the 
circumstance that circulating capital is furnished in the irst case and 
not in the second.
his suices to show how Mill was misled by the ambiguity of the 
word alimenter. Due to a double meaning he gives to the word, he 
announces that he is going to demonstrate one thing and he demon-
strates something quite diferent. He had to demonstrate that buying 
the product is not sustaining labor in the sense that buying a prod-
uct is not the same as demanding labor; and he demonstrates, not 
without diiculty, that buying a product is not the same as sustaining 
labor in the sense that buying a product is not the same as furnish-
ing circulating capital that is used in the manufacture of the product. 
Hence, we may consider the irst theorem as null and void.
312. Let us now consider the second one.
Wages, then, depend mainly upon the demand and supply of labour; or 
as it is oten expressed, on the proportion between population and capital. 
By population is here meant the number only of the labouring class, or 
rather of those who work for hire; and by capital only circulating capital, 
and not even the whole of that, but the part which is expended in the dir-
ect purchase of labour. To this, however, must be added all funds which, 
without forming a part of capital, are paid in exchange for labour, such as 
the wages of soldiers, domestic servants, and all other unproductive labour-
ers. here is unfortunately no mode of expressing by one familiar term, the 
aggregate of what has been called the wages-fund of a country: and as the 
wages of productive labour form nearly the whole of that fund, it is usual to 
overlook the smaller and less important part, and to say that wages depend 
on population and capital. It will be convenient to employ this expression, 
remembering, however, to consider it as elliptical, and not as a literal state-
ment of the entire truth.
With these limitations of the terms, wages not only depend upon the 
relative amount of capital and population, but cannot, under the rule of 
competition, be afected by anything else. Wages (meaning, of course, the 
general rate) cannot rise, but by an increase of the aggregate funds employed 
in hiring labourers, or a diminution in the number of the competitors for 
hire; nor fall, except either by a diminution of the funds devoted to paying 
labour, or by an increase in the number of labourers to be paid.v


he English theories of wages and interest 365

hat is a theory of wages that is more easily put into a mathematical 
form than is the theory of rent. he population in question does not 
include, we are told, idle persons, nor even all the persons who work; 
there is only the group of workers who earn a wage or the number 
of wage earners. Let T be this number. Mill explains, moreover, that 
the capital of which he is speaking does not include ixed capital; it 
is not even all the circulating capital, but only that part of the capital 
destined for paying wages, the working capital spent on labor. Let this 
amount be K. here is another point he deals with much more rap-
idly, but that must not escape us either. It appears that the rate to be  
determined is only the average wage rate. Let s be this rate. Having 
posited all this, to say that the wage rate is settled by the ratio of the 
population to capital, is the same as to say that s = K
 T

, namely that 
the average wage rate is equal to the quotient of the total amount of 
wages paid and the total number of people who receive a salary. It is 
undoubtedly not astonishing that a proposition of this type does not 
need further demonstration. Furthermore, also undoubtedly, it will 
not be a surprise that it cannot be of much use to us.
313. Let us irst make this observation: we do not need the average 
wage rate, but the wages paid in the various enterprises. And this is 
all the more necessary given that, in the English School’s system, we 
need the price of the productive services in order to determine the 
prices of the products. If these products consist of excavation works, 
we need the wage rate of excavation workers; if they are watches and 
clocks, we need the wage rates of the clockmakers. For this, the aver-
age wages, assumed to be determined by the formula, cannot be of 
any use to us; but is that rate really determined in that way? hat 
would certainly be the case if we knew the capital and the population 
as given data; that is to say, the amount of circulating capital available 
to pay for labor and the number of wage earners; unfortunately, those 
are magnitudes that are undetermined as utterly as they are perfectly 
deined. And far from their ratio being able to determine the wage 
rate, it is they that depend on this rate.
Whether the wage rate rises or falls, it is sure that the number of 
wage-earners will increase or decrease with the decrease or increase 


366 heory of capital formation and credit

of the other working classes, or even of the leisure classes; and it is 
equally certain that the amount of circulating capital destined for 
paying wages will increase or decrease with the decrease or increase 
of the other parts of circulating capital or even of ixed capital. It 
would be as impossible to distinguish the circulating capital used for 
wages from the circulating capital used for rent or the circulating 
capital used for ‘proits’ as to distinguish, in a tank with three outlet 
taps, the water destined to low from one tap from that destined to 
low from the other two. In such a container, the quantity of water 
passing through a tap will be determined, for each of the taps, by its 
width. It is exactly the same for the distribution of circulating capital 
in the form of wages, rent, and interest among the workers, land-
owners, and capitalists. If the wages were raised and the wage fund 
were insuicient, the fund would grow irst of all at the expense of the 
circulating capital used for rent and the circulating capital used for 
‘proits’. hen it would perhaps be the circulating capital that would 
be insuicient. he rate of interest on this capital would be very high 
compared with the rate of interest on ixed capital, and savings that 
are being formed, instead of becoming ixed capital, would circulate. 
Fewer shares and bonds would be bought at the Bourse, and larger 
deposits would be made in the banks. And if the wages to be paid 
were low and the circulating capital used for payment of wages were 
excessive, this fund would shrink to the advantage of the circulating 
capital used for land services and ‘proits’. hen there would perhaps 
be too much circulating capital. he rate of interest of this capital 
would be very low compared with the rate of interest on ixed cap-
ital, and savings in course of being made would become ixed capital 
instead of circulating capital. Deposits in the banks would be with-
drawn to acquire securities in the bourse.
herefore, instead of the wage rate being determined by the amount 
of circulating capital destined for payment of wages, it is rather that 
same amount that is determined by the wage rate. And what deter-
mines the wage rate, and the rates of rent and interest? hat is, what-
ever Mill may say about it, the price of the things in the production 
of which labor, land services, and ‘proits’ are used; that is to say, the 
competition of consumers in the market for products, and not that 
of entrepreneurs in the market for services. It is quite true that the 
productive services are bought in the market for services; but it is no 


he English theories of wages and interest 367

less true that their price is determined in the market for products. 
But there is no need to develop again here our theory of the deter-
mination of the price of the productive services, and it suices that 
we have shown what the English theory of wages is worth.
314. he theory of interest is no less important than that of rent and 
that of wages. It is a point at which the socialists have frequently 
aimed their attacks, attacks to which economists have not replied in 
a convincing manner until now.
First of all, an error that overshadows the entire theory of inter-
est, in particular in the work of the English School, is the confusion 
between the role of the capitalist and that of the entrepreneur. Under 
the pretext that, it is diicult in the real economy to be an entrepre-
neur without being at the same time a capitalist, they do not distin-
guish between the functions of the one and the other. his why the 
term proit used by them means both the interest on capital, and the 
proit of the enterprise. his detail must not be lost from view when 
their writings are read.
he confusion is regrettable. It is certainly diicult, but not impos-
sible, however, to be in fact an entrepreneur without being a cap-
italist: every day, we see men, who do not possess themselves any 
capital, but whose intelligence, honesty, and experience are known, 
ind funds that can be borrowed for an agricultural, industrial, com-
mercial, or inancial enterprise. In all these cases, and assuming that 
there are few entrepreneurs who are not capitalists, there is a great 
number of capitalists who are not entrepreneurs: they are holders of 
mortgage loans, unsecured loans, shares as a silent partner, or bonds. 
And inally, if the two roles were to be mixed together in practice 
even more oten than they are now, the theory should distinguish 
them nonetheless.
Concerning the part of the proit that constitutes the enterprise’s 
proit, the English School does not understand that it corresponds to 
a possible loss, that it is risky, that it depends on circumstances that 
are exceptional and not normal, and that, theoretically, it should be 
neglected. Concerning the part that constitutes interest on capital, 
the English School deines it as ‘the remuneration for the abstinence 
by the capitalist who has saved capital’. Here we will show how it 
determines the one as well as the other under the name of proit. It is 


368 heory of capital formation and credit

again from J.S. Mill that I here borrow the explanation of the English 
doctrine.
315. Basing itself on Ricardo’s theory of rent, it starts by establish-
ing, or, at least, it subsequently establishes that the advances of capital 
consist only of wages, or that rent does not form a part of the cost of 
production of agricultural products.
I undertook to show, (Mill writes), in the proper place, that this is an 
allowable supposition, and that rent does not really form any part of the 
expenses of production, or of the advances of the capitalist. he grounds 
on which this assertion was made are now apparent. It is true that all ten-
ant farmers, and many other classes of producers, pay rent. But we have 
now seen, that whoever cultivates land, paying a rent for it, gets in return 
for his rent an instrument of superior power to other instruments of the 
same kind for which no rent is paid. he superiority of the instrument is in 
exact proportion to the rent paid for it. If a few persons had steam-engines 
of superior power to all others in existence, but limited by physical laws to 
a number short of the demand, the rent which a manufacturer would be 
willing to pay for one of these steam-engines could not be looked upon as 
an addition to his outlay, because by the use of it he would save in his other 
expenses the equivalent of what it cost him: without it he could not do the 
same quantity of work, unless at an additional expense equal to the rent. 
he same thing is true of land. he real expenses of production are those 
incurred on the worst land, or by the capital employed in the least favour-
able circumstances. his land or capital pays, as we have seen, no rent; but 
the expenses to which it is subject, cause all other land or agricultural cap-
ital to be subjected to an equivalent expense in the form of rent. Whoever 
does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantages, and the rent which 
he pays does not place him in a worse position than, but only in the same 
position as, his fellow-producer who pays no rent, but whose instrument is 
one of inferior eiciency.1,vi
Rent having been eliminated in this way from the cost of produc-
tion, there remains in the costs, independently of interest, only wages, 
the rate of which is, according to the English School, determined by 
the ratio of capital to population. Consequently, the interest (or, as the 
English say, ‘the proit’, combining interest properly speaking with the 
proitvii of the enterprise) is easy to determine. Mill concludes:

1 J.S. Mill, Principles of Political Economie, L. II, Ch. XVI, § 6.


he English theories of wages and interest 369

he capitalist, then, may be assumed to make all the advances, and receive 
all the produce. His proit consists of the excess of the produce above the 
advances; his rate of proit is the ratio which that excess bears to the amount 
advanced.2,viii
his is therefore, briely, the English theory of the determination 
of the prices of productive services. he capitalists are the entrepre-
neurs; they compensate the landowners by paying them, in the form 
of rent, the excess of the products resulting from the more or less 
superior quality of their land, they compensate the workers by dis-
tributing among them, in the form of wages, the circulating capital 
used for those payments, and they remain the masters of the prod-
ucts. What is obtained by the entrepreneurs, ater deduction of costs, 
represents interest on their capital plus the proitix of their enterprise: 
this is the English School’s proit. We still have to discuss this theory 
mathematically in order to see on what point it is misleading.
316. Let P be the total of the products of an enterprise; let S, I, and 
F be the amounts of the wages, the interest, and the rent paid by 
the entrepreneur during the process of production as prices for the 
services of the personal faculties, the capital goods, and the land. 
Remember here that, according to the English School, the price of 
the products is determined by their cost of production; that is to say, 
it equals their average cost in terms of productive services; thus we 
have the equation
P = S + I + F.
P is therefore determined; only S, I, and F have still to be determined. 
And, indeed, if it is the price of the services that determines the price 
of the products, and not the price of the products that determines the 
price of the productive services, we need to be told by what the price 
of the productive services is determined. hat is just what the English 
economists undertake to do. To that end, they present us a theory of 
rent according to which rent is not included in the cost of produc-
tion; this changes the above equation into the following:

2 J.S. Mill, Principles of Political Economie, L. II, Ch. XV, § 5.


370 heory of capital formation and credit
P = S + I.
Ater this, they determine S directly by means of the theory of wages. 
hen, inally, they tell us that ‘the amount of interest or proit is the 
diference between the total price of the products and the cost of 
wages’; that is to say, I is determined by the equation
I = P − S.
Here it appears clearly that this determination eludes them, for one 
cannot, on the one hand, determine the term P by using the term I, 
and, on the other hand, determine the term I by using the term P. In 
sound mathematics, a single equation cannot be used to determine 
two unknowns. his is said with all reservations concerning the way 
in which the English School eliminates rent from the cost of produc-
tion and carries out the determination of wages.
317. However, let us see in what state economics is still in as far as 
concerns the determination of the prices of services. J.-B. Say had 
said, in chapter V of book I of his Traité d’economie politique:
An industrious person can lend his activity to someone who possesses 
only capital and land.
he owner of some capital can lend his capital to a person who has only 
land and industriousness.
he owner of a piece of land can lend it to a person who has only indus-
triousness and some capital.
When one lends industriousness, capital, or land, they are combined 
to create value; their use also has a value, and is remunerated in the 
ordinary way.
he payment for borrowed industriousness is called a wage.
he payment for borrowed capital is called interest.
he payment for borrowed land is called rent.
hat is a suiciently clear and exact conception of the combin-
ation of the three productive services in the production process. he 
wording used is good, so we have adopted it ourselves. But there 
remain important gaps to be illed in. In the irst place, J.-B. Say did 
not conceive of the distinctive role of the entrepreneur: this per-
sonage is lacking in his theory. Furthermore, Say gave an imperfect 
explanation of what services wages, interest, and rent are the price; 


he English theories of wages and interest 371

and his theory does not indicate, any more than did the Physiocrats’ 
theory, how the price is determined. Here, it would be necessary to 
introduce a valid theory of value, of the mechanism of exchange, of 
capital and income, of the mechanism of production, the concept of 
the entrepreneur, and of the market for products and services; but, 
during ity years, the French School of economics has not taken a 
single step in that direction; it has not produced any doctrine of eco-
nomic theory; it still does not know how interest, wages, and rent 
are determined.
Here is evidence of this ignorance; I have taken it from the work 
of P.A. Boutron titled heorie de la rente foncière,x awarded a prize 
by the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. he author starts 
by stating resolutely that the price of products is determined by their 
average cost. hen, he deines rent as ‘the excess of the price of prod-
ucts over their average cost in wages and interest’. If it were a question 
of furnishing the theory of wages, evidently he would have deined 
wages as ‘the excess of the price of the products over their average 
cost in interest and rent’. And if the Academy had organized a com-
petition for the theory of interest, he would undoubtedly have won 
the prize by deining interest as ‘the excess of the price of the prod-
ucts over their average cost in rent and wages’.
318. It is in place of these inadequate systems that we substitute the 
one in which the three main elements are the expositions of the 
mechanism of free competition in exchange (efective supply and 
demand; price increase, price decrease, current equilibrium price), 
presented in part II; of the mechanism of free competition in pro-
duction (land and its services, persons and labor, capital goods 
properly speaking and their services; landowners, workers, capital-
ists; entrepreneurs; proit, loss, equality of price and average cost) 
presented in part III; and of the mechanism of free competition in 
capital formation and credit (new capital goods properly speak-
ing, excess of income over consumption; ratio of total net income 
of new capital goods to the total excess of income over consump-
tion), presented in part IV. hanks to these fundamental concep-
tions, we have: 1° a market for services on which the services of 
land, the labor of persons, and the services of capital goods properly 
speaking are supplied by the landowners, workers, and capitalists, 


372 heory of capital formation and credit

who lower prices if there is an excess supply, and are demanded by 
the entrepreneurs and by landowners, workers, and capitalists, who, 
the former group in their role as producers and the latter group in 
their role as consumers, raise prices if there is an excess demand; 2° 
a market for products in which consumable products are supplied 
by entrepreneurs, who lower prices if there is an excess supply, and 
demanded by landowners, workers, and capitalists, who raise prices 
if there is an excess demand; and 3° a capital goods market in which 
new capital goods properly speaking are supplied by entrepreneurs, 
who lower prices if there is an excess supply, and demanded by capi-
talists, who, in their role as creators of savings, raise prices if there 
is an excess demand. And, consequently, we have also: 1° the prices 
of the services, or, rent, wages, and interest; 2° the prices of prod-
ucts; and 3° the rate of net income, and consequently the prices of 
land, personal capital, and movable capital. he demand for services 
and the supply of consumable products and new capital goods are 
determined by the entrepreneurs by their consideration of the proit 
that can be obtained or the loss that can be avoided. he supply of 
the services and the demand for consumable products and newly 
produced capital goods are determined by the landowners, workers, 
and capitalists according to the criterion of the maximum satisfac-
tion of wants.
Some people will perhaps ask me, as has indeed happened, whether 
it was really necessary, or even whether it was not more harmful than 
useful to present in mathematical form a doctrine that seems in itself 
simple enough and clear enough. My answer to that question will be 
as follows.
Asserting a theory is one thing, demonstrating it is another. I know 
that in economics every day so-called demonstrations are presented 
and received that are nothing other than gratuitous assertions. But, 
to be clear, I think that economics will not be a science until the day 
it compels itself to demonstrate that which it has practically limited 
itself so far to airming without justiication.. Now, to demonstrate 
that commodity prices, which are quantities, namely quantities of 
numeraire that can be exchanged for commodities, result efectively 
from such and such data or conditions, it is, in my opinion, abso-
lutely indispensible: 1° to formulate, on the bases of those data and 
conditions, a system of equations, rigorously equal in number to the 


he English theories of wages and interest 373

number of unknowns, of which the quantities in question are the 
roots, and 2° to prove that the interlinked phenomena in the real 
economy constitute indeed the empirical solution of this system of 
equations. his is what I have done successively for exchange, pro-
duction, and capital formation. And the use of the mathematical 
language and the mathematical method  did not only permit me to 
demonstrate thusly the laws of the establishment of the current prices 
in equilibrium, but it also permitted me to demonstrate, in addition, 
the laws of the variation in these prices, to analyze the fact of free 
competition, and in so doing, to put it on a sound base. Undoubtedly, 
the exposition of the system of free competition and its conirmation 
by reasoning are two distinct things that, united in my work, could, 
if necessary, be separated from each other. I do not oppose in any 
way the right of those of my readers who are economists without 
being mathematicians to leave aside the second of these two parts to 
beneit exclusively from the irst. Very few among us are capable of 
reading Newton’s Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy or 
Laplace’s Celestial Mechanics; and nevertheless, we all accept, on the 
authority of competent men, the description given to us of the world 
of astronomic facts ruled by the principle of universal attraction. 
Why should we not accept similarly the description of the world of 
economic facts ruled by the principle of free competition? Nothing 
therefore prevents leaving aside the demonstration of the system, 
once it has been made, and retaining only the contents of the system 
for use in the study of questions in applied economics or in prac-
tical economics; but, for my part, I had to develop the theory and to 
demonstrate it in order to outline, as I wanted to do, a truly scientiic 
theory of social wealth.

Notes

i Mill wrote ‘employ’.
ii Walras quoted a French translation of Mill’s book. he translator trans-
lated ‘employ’ as ‘alimenter’. Walras adopted the latter word in his represen-
tation of Mill’s sentence, and clearly did not consult Mill’s English text. 
Walras then presented a critique of the French rendering of the sentence, 
although the operative word ‘alimenter’ was certainly not what Mill would 
have used if he had translated the book into French. Walras’s critique is 
therefore misdirected. It is imperative, however, to present a translation of 


374 heory of capital formation and credit

‘alimenter’, rather than ‘employ’, because Walras’s text would otherwise not 
make sense.
iii Walras himself seems to be misled here by the enigmatic French version of 
Mill’s book, Principes d’économie politique, translated by H. Dussard and 
J.-G. Courcelle-Seneuil, page 94: ‘Acheter le produit n’est pas alimenter le 
travail.’ he verb ‘alimenter’ is the French equivalent of ‘to feed’, or ‘to sus-
tain’. In an inefectual efort to salvage more or less what Walras wrote, 
William Jafé, in his translation of Walras’s Éléments, did not present Mill’s 
wording (‘to purchase produce is not to employ labour’), but translated the 
French translation used by Walras in this way: ‘To purchase produce is not 
to support labour’ (our emphasis).he following citation of the opening 
section of § 9 of Chapter V of Book I may be of use:
We now pass to a fourth fundamental theorem respecting Capital, which is, per-
haps, otener overlooked or misconceived than even any of the foregoing. What 
supports and employs productive labour, is the capital expended in setting it to 
work, and not the demand of purchasers for the produce of the labour when com-
pleted. Demand for commodities is not demand for labour. he demand for com-
modities determines in what particular branch of production the labour and capital 
shall be employed; it determines the direction of the labour; but not the more or less 
of the labour itself, or of the maintenance or payment of the labour. hese depend 
on the amount of the capital, or other funds directly devoted to the sustenance and 
remuneration of labour.
he confusion has been caused by the notion of the ‘wage fund’ and its 
interpretation. We remark in passing that by ‘labour’, Mill meant ‘work’, not 
workers, otherwise he would have written in the second sentence of the 
quotation above: ‘what supports and employs productive labourers’, etc.

PART V

THEORY OF MONEY


377

LESSON 33

he problem of the value of money

SUMMARy: – he role of the numeraire; the role of circulating 
money and money saved. Framing the problem of the value of 
money. Hypothesis of a non-commodity money. he desired cash 
balance; the equation of circulation. he mechanism of circula-
tion; the market for money capital; the determination of the rate 
of interest. he law of the direct proportionality of the price of the 
money commodity to its quantity, and its inverse proportionality 
to the desired cash balance. he hypothesis of a commodity being 
money; its price curve as money; its price curve as a commod-
ity. he law of the establishment and variation of the price of the 
money commodity.
319. From the explanation I gave of the mechanism of free competi-
tion in matters of exchange, production, and capital formation, there 
follows quite evidently the necessity for having
1° A commodity in terms of which the prices of the other com-
modities are cried, or to the value of which the values of the other 
commodities are related, either in the market for services, or in the 
market for products, or in the capital market. his commodity then 
serves as the numeraire. As we have seen, one of the fundamental 
theorems of theoretical economics is the demonstration that, given 
m commodities (A), (B), (C), (D),  in a market, one can dispense 
with crying the m(m – 1) prices of the commodities taken two by 
two, and cry only the prices pb , pc , pd , of m – 1 of them, (B), (C), 
(D), , in terms of the mth, (A), taken as the numeraire.
2° A commodity obtained by selling services in the market for ser-
vices, and by means of which the products in the market for products 


378 heory of money

are bought, and that serves as circulating money. In fact, we sell our 
services to entrepreneurs who do not make the products we need, 
and we buy the products we need from entrepreneurs who do not use 
our services. Hence the necessity for a medium of exchange.
3° A commodity in which the excess of income over consumption 
is formed, and in which ixed and circulating capital is lent, and that 
serves as money savings. In fact, in general we do not use our savings 
to buy machines, instruments, tools, raw materials, products made 
to be ofered for sale, in order to lend them to entrepreneurs. We 
form our savings in money and we lend that money to entrepreneurs. 
Hence the necessity for the intermediation of credit.
But the designation of a commodity as circulating money and 
money savings has an efect, on its rareté and therefore on its value, 
that has to be studied.
320. In deciding that a certain commodity, gold or silver, Médoc 
wine or Havana cigars, will serve as money, its total quantity will be 
divided into two parts, one of which will be put into tills, wallets, and 
moneyboxes of the exchangers, while only the other part will be at 
the disposition of the consumers, drinkers, or smokers; consequently, 
its quantity as a commodity is decreased and its rareté is increased as 
well as its value compared with the value of the other commodities. 
In this way, the obscure and confusing controversy pursued with-
out a truce and without respite between the monometallists and the 
bimetallists on the subject of the value of the money commodity is 
eliminated. According to the former, this value is owed completely 
to its use as a commodity, and the law that designates the money 
has nothing to do with it; according to the latter, this value is owed 
completely to its use as money, and it is the law that designates the 
money that creates the value: νόμος law νόμισμα money. Well, they 
both see only half of the real and complete problem, which is as fol-
lows: the money commodity has, by itself and as a commodity, a cer-
tain value; but the law that designates it as money adds, so to speak, 
to this irst value a second value from which the overall and deinitive 
value results. How is this overall and deinitive value determined? 
And how is the total quantity of the money commodity divided into 
a quantity of commodity and a quantity of money? his is the prob-
lem of the value of money.


he problem of the value of money 379

To solve it as clearly as possible, we irst assume that a determinate 
quantity of a well-deined thing is chosen as circulating money and 
as money for savings, but that the thing is not useful, and that, con-
sequently, it does not have exchange value in and of itself, like certain 
stones, shells, chestnuts, or even pieces of paper with certain engrav-
ings on them. Undoubtedly, there is only one commodity properly 
speaking that must be selected as an intermediary in exchange and 
credit; in other words, money must be one of the sorts of social 
wealth. If laws and decrees were enacted that decree arbitrarily that 
stones or other similar objects had value and were legal tender, it is 
evident that, at the irst moment of trouble, the authorities having 
become powerless, the holders of this money would be ruined. Now, 
it is precisely in these circumstances that money must have the most 
value. his, however, is a matter of applied theory that we can put 
aside temporarily. In order to develop pure theory, it would evidently 
be advantageous for us to investigate how a thing takes on value as 
money before investigating how the value as money is combined 
with a value as a commodity.
321. Without wondering which natural circumstances can neces-
sitate the landowners, workers, and capitalists keeping, at a certain 
time, a more or less considerable amount of money, with a view to 
making more or less considerable purchases or savings, we assume 
in fact, for the sake of simplicity, that the amount of that money 
depends not only on the situation, but also on the characteristics 
and the habits of each person. And, indeed, here as well as in the 
case of the want curves, we can and must admit that the human will 
has a certain inluence, this inluence being exercised within lim-
its that are as wide as is wished, which does not prevent its conse-
quences from being subject to the laws of mathematics. Now, it must 
be clearly understood that when a consumer or a producer wishes 
to keep a certain stock of gold, silver, Médoc wine, Havana cigars, 
stones, shells, chestnuts, or paper money, his sole consideration is 
not the quantity of the money, which in itself is completely indif-
ferent to him, but the quantity of other commodities, products, ser-
vices, or capital goods that he can obtain in exchange for his money. 
herefore, on the conditions deined above for the equilibrium of 
exchange, production, and capital formation, let (U) be the item 


380 heory of money
chosen to be money; Qu the existing quantity of that item; (A), 
(B), (C), (D),  the consumable products; (T), , (P), , (K), (K′), 
(K″),  the capital goods, land services, personal services, and the 
services of capital properly speaking; (M), (M′),  the raw materials; 
pa , pc , pd ,, Pt ,, Pp ,, Pk ,Pk′ , Pk′′ ,, pt ,, pp ,, pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,, 
pm , pm′ , the prices of these commodities in terms of (B); and i the 
common rate of net income and of interest. Let a, b, c, d,  T, , P, 
, K, K ′, K″, , t, , p, , k, k′ , k″, , m, m′,  be the quantities 
of these same commodities of which the exchangers want to have the 
equivalent in money in their till. And let

It is evident that the existing quantity of (U), Qu , would take a value 
determined by the equation
Qu pu = H.
If we pass from the system of prices in terms of (B) to the system of 
prices in terms of (U), by dividing all the prices in terms of (B) by

and it is evident that, this cash balance being lent at the price Qui, the 
equilibrium of circulation would exist together with those of produc-
tion and capital formation. Indeed, in this way, we would always have 
the equilibrium of the exchange, because, the prices always being pro-
portional to the raretés, the consumers would always have maximum 
satisfaction of their needs; we would also always have the equilib-
rium of production, because, the prices of the products being always 


he problem of the value of money 381

equal to their average cost in terms of services, the entrepreneurs 
would never make proits or sufer losses; we would always have the 
equilibrium of capital formation, because, the net rate of revenue not 
having changed, the prices of the capital goods would always be pro-
portional to the prices of the services; and, inally, we would have the 
equilibrium of circulation, because the exchangers would have the 
desired cash balance at the rate of interest that has been announced. 
Moreover, it is obvious that, all other things remaining unchanged, if 
Qu increased or decreased, the equilibrium would maintain itself by 
a proportional rise or fall of all the prices, and that if H increased or 
decreased, it would maintain itself by a proportional fall or rise of all 
the prices. However, it remains to be demonstrated how this direct 
proportionality of the prices to the quantity of money and this indir-
ect proportionality of the prices to the desired cash balance tend to 
maintain themselves in a regime of free competition. And for this it 
remains to deine the mechanism of free competition in matters of 
circulation.
322. In order to reduce this mechanism to its essential elements, we 
will establish the identity of two circumstances.
First, supposing that ixed capital is rented partially in money and 
that all circulating capital is rented in money, we will not make any 
diference between the one and the other. In reality, these two types 
of capital are rented in two markets that are diferent but connected 
to each other, at two interest rates that difer but that depend on each 
other. We will ind all these diferences once again in the applied the-
ory of credit. Here, to develop the pure theory of money, we should 
neglect them. We will therefore consider only one market that we 
will call henceforth the market for money capital and no longer the 
market for numeraire capital, in which the entrepreneurs enter to 
demand money every day to constitute, complete, or maintain their 
ixed capital, consisting of machines, instruments, tools, and their 
circulating capital, consisting of raw materials and inished products. 
he interest generated by the circulating capital pays for the service 
of money during the time it is kept, and for the stocks of raw materi-
als and inished products, just like the interest generated by the ixed 
capital is the payment for the use of machines, instruments, tools. 
During the day, the entrepreneurs will buy, with their money, ixed 


382 heory of money

and circulating capital; and the next day, the sellers bring to the mar-
ket the money that they will have received, except for the part that 
they will need for themselves.
hen, we will no longer distinguish, from the point of view of 
hiring of ixed and circulating capital, between landowners, work-
ers, and capitalists as consumers on the one hand, and, on the other 
hand, entrepreneurs that are producers. Furniture, clothing, objects 
of art and luxury, and the stocks of consumer articles provide the 
same services to the former as do the stocks of raw materials and 
inished products to the latter. In both cases, the same price is paid 
for these services. Hence we assume that the landowners, workers, 
and capitalists, just like the entrepreneurs, come to the market for 
money capital every day to demand the money they need to consti-
tute, complete, or maintain their circulating and ixed capital. With 
their money they will buy, during the day, furniture, clothing, objects 
of art and luxury, and consumer goods; and the next day the sellers 
will also bring to the market the money they will have received.
If we join to this twofold demand for money the demand that will 
be efectuated by the creators of savings to buy new capital goods in 
order to rent them out in kind, we will have the daily demand for 
money in the market for money capital. And if we join the money 
brought by the sellers of these new capital goods to that brought, as 
we have said, by all the other entrepreneurs who will have received it 
the day before in exchange for commodities, and by the landowners, 
workers, and capitalists, who will have received it in exchange for 
their services, we will have the daily supply of money in the mar-
ket for money capital, equal to the existing quantity of money, that 
obtains on the market for money capital. If, at the rate of interest that 
is cried, demand is superior to supply, the rate will be raised and the 
producers and consumers will reduce their desired cash balances. If 
supply is superior to demand, the rate will be lowered and the pro-
ducers and consumers will increase their desired cash balances. he 
current rate of interest will be the one for which the demand for and 
the supply of money capital will be equal.
Such is the market that is at the same time the market for money 
capital and the money market. he daily demand for money that is 
brought to it is nothing other than the demand for that fraction of 
ixed and circulating capital of the society that is renewed every day, 
as we explained when discussing the permanent market (§ 271). 


he problem of the value of money 383

hose who borrow money in fact borrow ixed and circulating cap-
ital for which they exchange the money that same day. When they 
pay interest on the money borrowed, they pay the interest on the 
ixed and circulating capital represented by the money. It is there-
fore normal that the price to be cried in the market is the rate of 
interest on money capital. Alongside this rate, there is the rate of 
net income, which is always the ratio of the price of the service 
of new capital goods to the price of those goods themselves. And 
these two rates tend to equality because, according to whether the 
irst is greater or less than the second, the creators of savings and 
the borrowers are equally interested in either leaving money capital 
in the market or in withdrawing it; however, this does not mean 
that the two rates are any the less distinct. Moreover, according to 
whether savings will be substantial or slight, the part of the desired 
cash balances relating to consumption will be small or large, and 
the one relating to production large or small, and the rate of inter-
est low or high.
As I should have done, I have simpliied as much as possible. 
hose of my readers who would be eager to know the varied and 
complex details with which this mechanism can enrich itself in 
reality have only to read the ine book by Walter Bagehot, Lombard 
Street.i Furthermore, I have assumed that the total quantity of 
money existing is brought every day to the market. Given this 
hypothesis, the transformation of money savings into circulating 
money, and of circulating money into money saved, is just as fast 
as possible because all the money brought to the market during the 
morning is saved money, and becomes circulating money during 
the aternoon when it is exchanged for ixed and circulating cap-
ital. Ater some relection, one will see that this is really the ideal 
approached in a society in which one deposits the money from his 
sales in a current account at the bank, and takes from that account 
the money for his purchases, and in which the money in the tills, 
the purses, and the moneyboxes will decrease more and more. In a 
society in which money is kept in a cash register from the moment 
it is received until the day it is given as payment or until the day it 
is lent, money does not render much service, and those who keep it, 
be they producers or consumers, will unnecessarily lose the interest 
on the capital represented by the money. But, ater all, this circum-
stance does not change in any respect the essential mechanism of 


384 heory of money

monetary circulation and of the market for money capital. Its only 
consequence is that the desired cash balance is much more con-
siderable, and that, on the one hand, the daily supply of money 
is diminished by the existing quantity of money that is kept in 
reserve, while, on the other hand, its demand is diminished by a 
corresponding fraction of the desired cash balance; but the current 
rate of interest is always determined, as we have said, by the supply 
and the demand that occurs in the market.
323. he market for money capital having thus been deined, let us 
assume that, on a certain day, ater the determination of the current 
rate of interest equal to the rate of net income, the existing quantity 
Qu of money has decreased or that the desired cash balance H, rep-
resenting the utility of money, has increased. he next day, equilib-
rium in the market would only be established at a new, higher rate of 
interest and, accordingly, the desired cash balance would decrease. 
But, as a result of this reduction of the desired cash balance, all the 
prices of products, capital goods, services, and raw materials would 
fall; because of this fall, the desired cash balance would become again 
as it was before; and the day ater that equilibrium would establish 
itself at the current rate of interest equal to the rate of net income. 
he contrary would take place in the case of an increase of the exist-
ing quantity of money or of a decrease in the desired cash balance. 
Consequently: – If, all other things remaining unchanged, the existing 
quantity of money increases, or if the desired cash balance decreases, 
prices rise proportionally. If the existing quantity of money decreases, 
or if the desired cash balance increases, prices fall proportionally. his 
law extends to money the principle by virtue of which value increases 
with utility and decreases with quantity. his is, in itself, plausible 
enough; and many economists have already formulated it at least as 
far as it concerns the ratio of the variation in the prices to the vari-
ation in the quantity of money; but I am doing something more by 
demonstrating it mathematically by means of all the foregoing eco-
nomic theories.
324. It is therefore well established that, if money (U) is something 
that is not a commodity, its price in terms of (B) is given by the 
equation


he problem of the value of money 385

Qu pu = H.
Let us now assume that we take as money a commodity (A) exist-
ing in total quantity Qa, of which a quantity Qa′ will retain its char-
acter as a commodity, while a quantity Qa′′ will be given the form of 
money; in consequence of which the price of (A) will rise from pa to 
Pa , and the latter price will satisfy the equation

Now, since a is very small compared to H, we may neglect the term 
a(Pa − pa ) and consider the price of money (A) in terms of (B) as 
given by the equation
Qa′′Pa = H.
Let there now be two rectangular axes (Fig. 28): a horizontal price 
axis op, and a vertical quantity axis oq.
We have just seen that the price curve of (A) as money in terms of 
another commodity (B) is, as a function of the quantity of (A), if we 
neglect an insigniicant term, a rectangular hyperbola with axes as 
asymptotes and with equation
q H

= p ;
that is to say, a curve such that the product of its ordinates, repre-
senting quantities of (A) as money, and its abscissa, representing the 
price of money in terms of (A), is constant and equal to the magni-
tude H of the desired cash balance in terms of (B), which is assumed 
to be determined.
Now, we know on the other hand (§ 226) that the price curve of 
(A) as commodity in terms of (B), as a function of the quantity, is a 
curve Aq Ap (Fig. 29) that has the equation
q = Fa (p);


386 heory of money

that is to say, such a curve that, the quantity of (A) decreasing from 
a inite quantity represented by the length oAq to zero, the price of 
(A) increases always from zero to a price, ininite or not, represented 
by the length oAp .
hat having been stated, it is really easy to understand that the 
price curve of (A), in terms of (B), considered both as a commod-
ity and as money, is, as a function of the quantity, a curve passing 
through the point G the equation of which isii
q p H

= Fa ( ) + p
and that can be obtained graphically by superposing, for all the 
abscissas, the ordinates of the curve h″Hh′ upon the ordinates of 
the curve Aq Ap. Indeed, this construction having been made, let 
oA be a length representing the total quantity Qa of (A); if we draw 
the horizontal line AG until it meets the superior curve, and if we

draw downwards the perpendicular GP, we will get the abscissa oP, 
the representation of the price Pa of (A), as commodity and money, 
corresponding to the quantity Qa. And furthermore, we will have [in 
Figures 28 and 29] the lengths oa = PF and aA = oα = FG, repre-
senting, respectively, the quantities Qa′ and Qa′′ of (A) as a commod-
ity and (A) as money when there will be no transformation of (A) 
as commodity into (A) as money nor of (A) as money into (A) as 
commodity.
If, instead of dividing the quantity Qa into Qa′ and Qa′′, as we did 
just above, we had divided Qa randomly into two quantities, the 
one represented by oa′ > oa, and the other by a′A = oα′ < oα , 
the price of (A) as a commodity would be represented by op′ < oP 
and the price of (A) as money by oπ′ > oP; commodity would then 
be transformed into money, which would diminish oa′ , increase 
oα′, and, consequently, increase op′ and diminish oπ′. And, if

we had divided randomly into two quantities, the one represented 
by oa″<oa, and the other by a″A = oα″ > oα, the price of (A) as 
a commodity would be represented by op″ > oP and the price of 
(A) as money by oπ″ < oP; money would then be transformed into 
commodity, which would increase oa″, diminish oα″, and, con-
sequently, diminish op″ and increase oπ″. So, our construction 
furnishes the solution of the problem of the determination of: 1° the 
price of the money commodity (A), 2° the quantity of (A) as a com-
modity, and 3° the quantity of (A) as money, just as takes place in 
reality by tatonnements as is shown very well by Figures 28 and 29.
Hence – In the case of a unique monetary standard, the common 
and identical price in terms of any other commodity of the money com-
modity as a commodity and as money is determined by minting or 
demonetization depending on whether the price of the money is higher 
than the price of the commodity or the reverse.
325. he two curves h″ Hh′ and Aq Ap and the length oA thus being 
the elements of the establishment of the price of the money commod-
ity and of the respective quantities as a commodity and as money, they 
are also, for the same reason, the elements causing variations in that 
price and those quantities. Hence, it will suice to examine the efects 
of shits of the curves h″ Hh′ and Aq Ap, and the efects of changes in 
the length oA , in order to give an account of all the phenomena of 
variations in the price of the money commodity and of the respect-
ive quantities as a commodity and as money. For example, the curve 
h″ Hh′ moves away from or approaches the origin o in accordance 
with the increase or decrease of the magnitude of the desired cash 
balance; the curve Aq Ap moves away from or approaches the origin 
o in accordance with the increase or decrease of the utility of (A) as a 
commodity. Now, depending on whether the two curves move away 
from or approach the origin, the price of (A) increases or decreases. 
Hence, this price increases or decreases with the increase or decrease 
of the magnitude of the desired cash balance and the utility of the com-
modity. Concerning the length oA, it increases or decreases with 
the increase or decrease of the quantity of (A). Now, according to 
whether this length increases or decreases, the price of (A) decreases 


he problem of the value of money 389

or increases. Hence, this price increases or decreases with the increase 
or decrease of the quantity of the commodity.

Notes
i Lombard Street, a Description of the Money Market, third edition, London: 
H.S. King, 1873.
ii he equation that follows must then be seen as giving p implicitly as a 
function of q. Walras deines a price curve as q as a function of p (see, for 
example, in this section above and § 151), so the equation is that of a price 
curve. He also writes, however: ‘the purchase curve has a very remarkable 
character: it becomes a curve of the price as a function of the total quantity 
in existence, since its abscissas give the price of the commodity as a func-
tion of the total quantity in existence represented by its ordinates’ (§ 152). 
Walras therefore meant that the curve through G in the graph can be con-
sidered as the price curve showing q as a function of p, as well as the curve 
portraying p as a function of q (compare Jafé’s translation, which obscures 
these features (Walras 1954, p. 335)). he former is given by the equation 
above, whereas the price as a function of the quantity is given by solving the 
equation for p as a function of q. Since Walras is concerned with the div-
ision, at each price, of the total quantity of the substance (A) into the part 
that is used as money and the part that is used as a commodity, he shows q 
as the dependent variable in the graph by putting it on the vertical axis.

LESSON 34

Mathematical theory of bimetallism

SUMMARy: – In the monometallic system, there are three equa-
tions to determine the three unknowns of the problem of the value 
of money; in the bimetallic system, there are only ive equations 
to determine six unknowns; a sixth equation has to be introduced. 
his sixth equation can be obtained by ixing a legal ratio between 
the value of gold money and silver money. once that ratio is 
ixed, the ratio of the value of gold as a commodity to the value 
of silver as a commodity tends to equal to the former ratio by the 
transformation of each of these two metals from money into a 
commodity or from a commodity into money. Equation of bimet-
allism. Geometric solution of the equations of bimetallism. Law 
of the establishment of the common and identical price of the two 
money commodities. Increase and decrease in the quantity of each 
metal. Efects of a suspension or a resumption of minting silver.
326. he dispute between the monometallists and the bimetal-
lists shows strikingly, by lack of the application of the only appro-
priate method of studying essentially quantitative facts, how there 
are let obscure and uncertain some fundamental points in these 
questions that it would be possible, if one so wished, to clarify with 
mathematical rigor.
In the preceding lesson, titled ‘he problem of the value of money’, 
I showed that, if we use one single commodity (A) as money, there 
are just three unknowns:
1° the quantity of (A) that remained a commodity;
2° the quantity of (A) that became money;


Mathematical theory of bimetallism 391

3° the common price of (A) as a commodity and of (A) as money 
in terms of any other commodity.
here are three equations, expressing:
1° that the sum of the quantities of (A) as a commodity and of (A) 
as money is equal to the total quantity of (A);
2° how the price of (A) as a commodity depends on the quantity 
of (A) as a commodity;
3° how the price of (A) as money depends on the quantity of (A) 
as money.
If we now employ simultaneously two commodities (A) and (o) as 
money, there will be six unknowns:
1° the quantity of (A) as a commodity;
2° the quantity of (A) as money;
3° the quantity of (o) as a commodity;
4° the quantity of (o) as money;
5° the price of (A) as a commodity and as money;
6° the price of (o) as a commodity and as money.
But, to determine those six unknowns, there are no more than ive 
equations, expressing:
1° that the sum of the quantities of (A) as a commodity and of (A) 
as money is equal to the total quantity of (A);
2° that the sum of the quantities of (o) as a commodity and of (o) 
as money is equal to the total quantity of (o);
3° how the price of (A) as a commodity depends on the quantity 
of (A) as a commodity;
4° how the price of (o) as a commodity depends on the quantity 
of (o) as a commodity;
5° how the price of (A) as money and the price of (o) as money 
depend together on the quantities of (A) as money and of (o) as 
money.
If three commodities were used simultaneously as money, there 
would be only seven equations to determine nine unknowns.
If four commodities were used simultaneously as money, there 
would be only nine equations to determine twelve unknowns. And 
so forth.


392 heory of money

So, in the case of a unique standard, the problem is completely 
determinate and is solved automatically in the market by the mech-
anism of free competition. he legislator has nothing to do except to 
designate the money commodity (A), to permit the transformation 
of (A) from money into commodity if the value of (A) as a commod-
ity is greater than the value of (A) as money, and to transform, if so 
asked, commodity into money as soon as the value of (A) as money 
is greater than the value of (A) as a commodity.
on the other hand, in the case of a double standard, the problem is 
not completely determined, and the legislator can intervene to deter-
mine arbitrarily one of the six unknowns or introduce in one way or 
another a sixth equation. For example, he could determine arbitrarily 
the quantity of (A) as money, or the quantity of (o) as money, or the 
ratio of the irst quantity to the second one. In the latter case, we have a 
bimetallism at a ixed ratio of quantities.1 Alternatively, he could deter-
mine arbitrarily the price of (A) as money or the price of (o) as money, 
or the ratio of the irst price to the second one. In this case, we have 
bimetallism at a ixed ratio of values. If he bases the arbitrary determin-
ation on quantity, the value will be determined automatically in the 
market. If he bases it on value, the quantities will be determined auto-
matically in the market through the mechanism of free competition.
327. If we assume that the latter option has been chosen by ixing at 
15½, as the bimetallists are demanding, the ratio of the value of gold 
money to the value of silver money, here is how the respective quan-
tities of minted and unminted gold and silver will be established as a 
consequence. When the ratio of the value of gold as a commodity to 
the value as silver as a commodity is greater than 15½, not only all the 
gold extracted from the mines will be used for jewellery or utensils, 
but, furthermore, a part of the gold money will be transformed into 
a commodity, while, at the same time, all the silver extracted from 
the mines will be minted, and, moreover, a part of silver as a com-
modity will be transformed into silver money. Hence, the quantity of 
gold money will diminish, and that of silver money will increase. he 
1 In an article titled ‘on Remedies for Fluctuations in Prices’, in the Contemporary 
Review of March 1887, Alfred Marshall outlined a monetary system that is 
nothing other than bimetallism at a ixed ratio of quantities. [he article has 
been reprinted in Memorials of Alfred Marshall, edited by A.C. Pigou, London: 
Macmillan, 1925, pages 188–211.]


Mathematical theory of bimetallism 393

quantity of gold as a commodity will increase, and that of silver as a 
commodity will decrease; and that will continue until the ratio of the 
value of gold as a commodity to the value of silver as commodity has 
fallen back to 15½. When the ratio of the value of gold as a commod-
ity to the value of silver as a commodity is less than 15½, the inverse 
phenomena will take place. he quantity of gold money will increase; 
that of silver money will decrease. he quantity of gold as commodity 
will decrease; that of silver as commodity will increase; and that will 
continue until the ratio of the value of gold as money to the value of 
silver as money has risen again to 15½.
From these explanations it follows that the monometallists are 
wrong when they maintain categorically that promising that the 15½ 
rate is irrevocable is promising the impossible. Within certain limits, 
that irrevocability is possible without violating free competition. But 
it follows also that the bimetallists themselves are wrong in thinking 
that the ratio 15½, being ixed as the legal ratio of the value of gold as 
money to the value of silver as money, will be, by this very act, imme-
diately and forever, the natural ratio of the value of gold as a com-
modity to the value of silver as a commodity. A single commodity can 
be money; in becoming money, it remains nonetheless a commodity, 
and as such it has nonetheless a price determined by the law of sup-
ply and demand. Exceptionally and for a moment, this price can be 
sometimes greater and sometimes less than the price of money, and, 
consequently, it can be advantageous for a miner to bring his metal 
sometimes to the market, sometimes to the Mint, and for the money 
changer sometimes to melt coins, sometimes to mint ingots. We see 
this every day in the system of a unique standard, as well as in the 
system of a double standard. Undoubtedly, in the latter case, the ratio 
of 15½ imposed on the two metals as money by the legislator will be 
imposed on these metals as commodities by the mechanism of free 
competition, but not immediately nor forever. Greater than 15½, the 
ratio of the value of gold as a commodity to the value of silver as a 
commodity can only be lowered by the demonetization of gold, and 
as long as there is gold to be demonetized; subsequently, the rate will 
maintain itself at 16, 17, 18, . Less than 15½, this same rate can only 
be raised by the demonetization of silver, and as long as there is silver 
to be demonetized; subsequently, the rate will maintain itself at 15, 14, 
13, . he bimetallists tell us, rightly or wrongly, that the present fall 
of the value of silver is to be attributed to the action of the law, and 


394 heory of money

not to that of nature; but they cannot seriously think they can guar-
antee us that the latter action will never take place. It is therefore of 
utmost importance to know that in the bimetallic system there can 
occur such an increase of the quantity of silver that a demonetization 
of the total quantity of gold will be brought about, and this will oblige 
us to make our large payments by means of very heavy sums, or there 
can occur such an increase of the quantity of gold that a demonetiza-
tion of the total quantity of silver will be brought about, and this will 
oblige us to fulill our small payments by means of extremely small 
coins; that is to say that the system of the double standard at the legal 
rate of 15½, whether local or universal, still is, ater all the system of 
the alternative standard in which the depreciated metal has driven 
the appreciated metal more or less out of circulation.
his is the theory that must be developed mathematically.
328. he geometrical demonstration presented in lesson 33 corres-
ponds with the algebraic solution of the three equations
Qa = Qa′ + Qa′′,
Qa′ = Fa (Pa ),
Q′′ H

a = Pa ,
to determine the three unknowns Pa ,Qa′ and Qa′′. Hence, in this case, 
there are indeed three equations for the determination of three 
unknowns.
Let now (A) and (o) be two commodities used simultaneously 
as money; let Qa and Qo be their respective total quantities, Qa′ and 
Qo′ the quantities that have remained commodities, Qa′′ and Qo′′ their 
quantities in the form of money. Let Pa and Po be their prices in 
terms of any third commodity (B). For the determination of these six 
unknowns, we have the ive equations:
Qa = Qa′ + Qa′′, [1]
Qo = Qo′ + Qo′′, [2]


Mathematical theory of bimetallism 395

expressing that the total quantities of (A) and (o) are equal to the 
sums of the quantities of (A) as a commodity and of (A) as money 
and the quantities of (o) as a commodity and of (o) as money;
Qa′ = Fa (Pa ), [3]
Qo′ = Fo (Po ), [4]
expressing how the prices of (A) as a commodity and (o) as a com-
modity result from the quantities of (A) as a commodity and (o) as 
a commodity;
Qa′′Pa + Qo′′Po = H, [5]
expressing that the quantity of (A) as money and the quantity of (o) 
as money yield together the desired cash balance.
In order to complete the determination of the problem, we can, if 
we wish to do so, state the following equation
Po = ωPa , [6]2
that ixes a ratio between Pa and Po . his is what happens when the 
state declares that 1 of (o) and ω of (A) are equivalent as means of 
payment.
329. Bringing the value Po from the equation [6] into the equations 
[4] and [5], and then the values of Qa′ and Qo′ taken from [3] and the 
modiied equation [4] into the equations [1] and [2], we obtain
Qa = Fa (Pa ) + Qa′′,
Qo = Fo (ωPa ) + Qo′′,
2 In bimetallism with a ixed ratio of quantities, the sixth equation would be
Qa′′= αQo′′,
and the mathematical theory of the system would be given by the solution of six 
equations just as that theory is going to be given for the case of bimetallism with 
a ixed ratio of values.


396 heory of money

hence
Qa′′= Qa − Fa (Pa ),
Qo′′= Qo − Fo (ωPa ).
Bringing these values of Qa′′ and Qo′′ into the modiied equation [5], 
we obtain
Qa − Fa (Pa ) Pa +Qo − Fo (ωPa ) ωPa = H,
hence
Q Q p H

a + ω o = Fa ( a ) + Pa + ωFo (ωPa );
an equation from which Pa can be deduced, and that is amenable to 
a very simple geometric solution.
Let there be given (Fig. 31) two rectangular axes: a price axis, op, 
horizontal, and a quantity axis, oq, vertical.
Let the curve through the point H in Figure 28 (§ 324) be a rect-
angular hyperbola with the two axes as asymptotes that has the 
equation
q H

= p ;
let AqAp (Fig. 30) be the curve of price of (A) as a commodity in 
terms of (B), as a function of the quantity, with equation
q = Fa ( p);
and let oqop (Fig. 31) be the curve of the price of (o) as a commodity 
in terms of (B), as a function of the quantity, with equation
q = Fo (p).
I now subject this equation to the following transformation. on the 
horizontal axis, starting from o, I mark the abscissa 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,  


Mathematical theory of bimetallism 397

equal to 1
ω

 times the abscissa 15, 20, 25, 30,  (in the igure, ω is 
equal to 10). And on the lines parallel to the vertical axis through the 
irst abscissa, I mark, measured from the horizontal axis, ordinates 
Oq′ , s′, s′′, s′′′,  equal to ω times the ordinates r, r′, r″, r′′′, . In 
this way, I obtain the curve o′qo′p with equation
q = ωFo (ωp).
his transformation will immediately become evident if we recognize 
that, in the system of the ixed ratio between the values of (A) and 
(o), 1 of (o) may be replaced by ω of (A) at a price that is ω times

(o) in the form of (A).
hese preparations having been made, the geometrical solution of 
the equation
Q Q P H

a + ω o = Fa ( a ) + Pa + ωFo (ωPa )
can be achieved as follows.
In Fig. 30, I superpose graphically, for all the abscissas, the ordi-
nates of the curve passing through the point H [Fig. 28], on the ordi-
nates of the curve AqAp, and obtain in this way the curve µ′Km″ 
with equation

hen, I superpose graphically, for all the abscissas, the ordinates of 
the curve o′qo′p on the ordinates of the curve µ′Km″, and obtain in 
this way the curve ν′Nn″ with equation

Now, let oA be a length representing the total quantity Qa of (A), 
and AB a length representing ω times the total quantity of (o), hence 
ωQo ; if we draw the horizontal line BN until it meets the uppermost 
curve, and if, from the point N, we draw downwards the perpendicu-
lar PN, we obtain, in the form of the abscissa oP, the representation 
of the price Pa of (A) as a commodity and as money corresponding 
to the quantity Qa. And, moreover, we get, in the form of the lengths 
P I and IM , the representation of the respective quantities Qa′ and 
Qa′′ of (A) as a commodity and (A) as money, when there will be 
no transformation of (A) as a commodity into (A) as money, nor 
of (A) as money into (A) as a commodity. Furthermore, we have in 
the abscissa 50 = ωoP (Fig. 31) the representation of the price Po 
of (o) as a commodity and as money corresponding to the quantity  
Qo. Moreover, we have, in the form of the lengths NK and KM 
(Fig. 30), the representation of ω times the respective quantities Qo′ 
and Qo′′ of (o) as a commodity and (o) as money, when there will 
be no transformation of (o) as a commodity into (o) as money, nor 
of (o) as money into (o) as a commodity. Exactly as in the case of 
a unique standard, it can be demonstrated that, if instead of divid-
ing the quantities Qa and Qo into Qa′ and Qa′′ and into Qo′ and Qo′′, 
as has been done above, we had divided them randomly into difer-
ent quantities, there would have occurred, depending on the case, a 
transformation of (A) as a commodity into (A) as money or a trans-
formation of (A) as money into (A) as a commodity, and a transform-
ation of (o) as a commodity into (o) as money or a transformation 
of (o) as money into (o) as a commodity. For this, it would suice 
to assume that the three parts of the length NP difer from PI , IK 
and IM and are diferently placed between the axis oP and the three 
curves AqAp, µ′Km″, and ν′Nn″. I abstain from repeating this dem-
onstration for the sake of brevity and in order not to complicate the 
igure, which must serve for demonstrating another point.


400 heory of money

Hence: – In the case of two interdependent standards, just as in the 
case of a unique standard, the common and identical price in terms of 
any other commodity of each of the two money commodities as mer-
chandise and as money is established by monetization or demonetiza-
tion according to whether the price of money is greater than the price of 
the commodity or vice versa.
330. he three curves H, AqAp, oqop, the lengths oA and AB, and 
the ratio ω, thus being the elements of the establishment of the price 
of the two money commodities and that of their respective quantities 
as a commodity and as money, are also, by this very fact, the elem-
ents of the variation in these prices and these quantities. Here again, 
it would suice to examine subsequently the efects of displacements 
of the curves H, AqAp, oqop, and the efects of changes in the lengths 
oA and AB, and in the ratio ω, to see all the phenomena of vari-
ation in the price of the two money commodities as money and their 
respective quantities as commodities and as money. And by com-
paring the results of this study for the case of two interdependent 
standards with the results of a similar study for the case of a unique 
standard, one could declare, having complete knowledge of the mat-
ter, what the respective merits of monometallism and bimetallism 
are from the point of view of the greatest possible stability of the 
value of the numeraire and of money. his is what we want to do 
in the next lesson, but irst we are going to study here the efects of 
changes in the lengths oA and AB corresponding with changes in 
the quantities Qa and Qo .
Let us irst assume that Qa, represented by oA, remains constant, 
and that Qo, represented by MN
ω

, increases to a quantity represented 

by m′n′
ω

, or decreases to a quantity represented by m″n″
ω

. Figure 30 
shows that, in the irst case, the total quantity of silver, represented 
by p′m′, would be a commodity, and that the monetary circulation 
would exclusive be served by gold, whereas, in the second case, the 
total quantity of gold, represented by m″n″
ω

, would be a commodity,

and the monetary circulation would be served by silver. he igure 
shows also that, if Qo would increase to a quantity greater than m′n′
ω

,

 

or decrease to a quantity less than m″n″
ω

, the price of silver would 
then remain equal to p′ or p″, whereas the price of gold would 
become less than p′ or greater than p″; the ratio of the value of gold 
as a commodity would be less than ω in the irst case, and greater 
than ω in the second case.
We now assume that, while Qo, represented by MN
ω ω ω

= µ′ν′ = µ″ν″ , 
remains unchanged, Qa, represented by P M, increases to a quantity 
represented by π′µ′, or decreases to a quantity represented by π″µ″. 
he igure shows us that, in the irst case, the total quantity of gold, 
represented by µ′ν′
ω

, would become a commodity, and that the mon-
etary circulation would be served exclusively by silver, whereas, in 
the second case, the total quantity of silver, represented by π″µ″, 
would become a commodity and the monetary circulation would be 
served exclusively by gold. he igure shows also that, if Qo would 
increase to a quantity greater than π′µ′, or decrease to a quantity 
less than π″µ″, the price of gold would remain equal to π′ or π″, 
while the price of silver would become less than π′, or greater than 
π″, and the ratio of the value of gold as a commodity to the value of 
silver as a commodity would be greater than ω in the irst case and 
less than ω in the second case.i
I have done enough, I think, to show how the question of mono-
metallism versus bimetallism has until now been studied only 
supericially, and to put on the right track the persons who wish 
to make a more profound study of the subject. on the one hand, it 
is absolutely necessary that the monometallists give up answering 
the bimetallists in the same way, namely ‘that it is just as diicult 
for the State to maintain a ixed ratio between the value of gold and 
the value of silver as it is between the value of wheat and that of 


402 heory of money

rye’. It is quite easy for the State to maintain a ixed ratio between 
the value of gold and the value of silver, and, once introduced, this 
ratio will tend indirectly to become the ratio of the value of gold as 
a commodity and the value of silver as a commodity. However, the 
bimetallists, too, must give up protesting ‘that money can change in 
value by changing its form’, and maintaining ‘that there is a constant 
identity between the value of the metal in bullion, of the metal in 
numeraire, and of the metal in jewellery’.3 his identity of the value 
of the metal as a commodity and the value as money, is far from 
being constant, and can only be maintained by monetization or by 
demonetization of metal, and ceases to exists when there is no more 
metal to demonetize.
331. he formulas used in the present theory, apart from the fact 
that they clarify the principle of bimetallism, could also furnish the 
means to give an explanation of the results of a practical application 
of this system. If the arbitrarily chosen functions or curves above are 
substituted, all or in part, by functions or curves with concrete coef-
icients, we will be able to calculate approximately the real efects of 
a resumption of the monetization of silver on the basis of some legal 
ratio between the value of gold as money and the value of silver as 
money. Let us assume that, in the country to which our curves cor-
respond, an increase of the quantity of silver has taken place ater the 
establishment of equilibrium, and that the occurrence of the natural 
and necessary efects of the legal ratio has been prevented by the sus-
pension of minting silver. In this case, the quantity of silver money 
still being represented by IM, and its price still being represented by 
oP, the quantity of silver as a commodity will be represented by P′I′,  
and its price by oP′. If minting silver is then resumed, the efects of 
the legal ratio are produced by the superposition of the lengths P′I′ 
and IM and by the placement of this total length to π′ν′, between the 
points P and P′. It is evident that, within this framework, minting a 
certain quantity of silver will have as a reaction the demonetization 
of a certain quantity of gold, and the rise of the price of silver as a

Mathematical theory of bimetallism 403
commodity from oP′ to oπ′ will have as a reaction the fall of the 
price of silver as money from oP to oπ′ and of the price of gold as a 
commodity and as money from ωoP to ωoπ′. If concrete numbers 
would be useful to make the chain of phenomena understood more 
easily, here are some relating to our country and to our igure. In the 
situation of equilibrium, resulting from the ratio ω = 10, the total 
quantity of silver, oA = PM = 5 billion demi-decagrams, is divided 
into PI = 2 billion of silver as a commodity and IM = 3 billion of 
silver as money; and the quantity of gold, AB MN

10 = 10 = 433 million 

demi-decagrams, is divided into MK

10 = 100 million of gold as money 

and KN

10 = 333 of gold as a commodity. he price of silver in terms 
of wheat is 5 pounds, that of gold is 50 pounds per demi-decagram. 
In other words, wheat is worth 0.20 F per pound. he total quantity 
of silver increases, by hypothesis by 2 billion, and, the minting of sil-
ver being suspended, the quantity of silver as a commodity would be 
raised from 2 to 4 billion; as a consequence of this, its price would 
fall from 5 to 1.66 pounds of wheat per demi-decagram. one could 
therefore buy 1 unit of silver as a commodity with 0.33 = 1.66/5 units 
of silver as money. If minting silver is resumed, 2 billion 1.66 mil-
lion of silver would remain as a commodity, and 1 billion 833 mil-
lion would be transformed into money; and, on the other hand, the 
100 million of gold as money would be transformed into a commod-
ity. he price of silver as a commodity would be raised from 1.66 to 
4.33 pounds; conversely, the price of silver as money would diminish 
from 5 to 4.33 pounds, and the price of gold as a commodity and as 
money from 50 to 43.33 pounds of wheat per demi-decagram. In 
other words, wheat would then be worth 1
4 33

 franc

.

 = 0.23 F per pound. 
We see that there would have been a 15 per cent rise in the prices of 
all commodities.

Note
i First, Walras shits MN to the let while leaving N on the curve ν′Nn″ ; M 
will then follow a curve ‘parallel’ to ν′Nn″ ; the latter curve intersects ν′Nn″ 
at ν′ . Second, he shits MN to the right while leaving N on the curve ν′Nn″ ; 
M will then again follow a curve ‘parallel’ to ν′Nn″ ; this curve intersects 
ν′Nn″ at the point n″ . Walras drew his curves in such a way that these 
points of intersection do indeed exist, but that outcome is not always certain. 
herefore, it seems clear that the argument presented in this section cannot 
be substantiated in general by means of Figure 30 because it is not certain that 
the points ν′ and n″ always exist. Walras should have interchanged the roles 
of gold and silver, and, therefore, should have made a new igure for this case, 
in which the following function would have to be depicted:

LESSON 35

Relative stability of the value of the 
bimetallic standard

SUMMARy: – Construction of the ive curves of variation of the 
price in terms of wheat: 1° and 2° of the silver franc that is both a 
commodity and money and of the gold franc that is only a com-
modity on the hypothesis of the silver standard; 3° and 4° of the 
gold franc that is both a commodity and money and of the sil-
ver franc that is only a commodity on the hypothesis of the gold 
standard; 5° of the silver franc and of the gold franc each of them 
both a commodity and money on the hypothesis of bimetallism. 
Similarity of the curves of the variation of the price of the metal at 
the same time a commodity and money, and of the metal as only 
a commodity. Conditions of viable bimetallism. Intermediate pos-
ition of the bimetallic curve. Transformation of bimetallism into 
monometallism. Limits of the compensatory action of bimetal-
lism. Jevons’s error. Seeking greater ixity of value of the standard.
332. To complete the mathematical theory of bimetallism, it remains 
for me to discuss the system of bimetallism from the point of view of 
the stability of the value of the monetary standard.
Let us call, in the bimetallic system, the unit of quantity of silver, 5 
grams or a demi-decagram of silver 0.9 ine, a silver franc, and a gold 
franc, not as has been done, the unit of quantity of gold at 5 grams 
or a demi-decagram of gold 0.9 ine, but instead the ωth part of that 
unit. In our Figure 31, where ω was assumed to be equal to ten, this 
gold franc was half a gram. In this case, the curve oq′o′p with equa-
tion q = ωFo (ωPa ) that we have substituted for the curve oqop with 
equation q = Fo (p), was the curve of the price in terms of wheat of 
the gold franc as a commodity as a function of the quantity.


406 heory of money

Let there now be two rectangular axes (Fig. 32): a horizontal time 
axis ot, and a vertical price axis op. on the irst one, we mark equal 
lengths 0 −1, 1 − 2 ,  corresponding to the unit of time or, more 
exactly, to the equal intervals that separate the calculations of the 
prices assumed to be brought about by the mathematical data. on 
the second axis, and on the parallels drawn from the points 1, 2, , 
we measure lengths corresponding to:
1° the price in terms of wheat of the silver franc as a commodity 
and as money, supposing silver only serves as money;
2° the price in terms of wheat of the gold franc as a commodity, 
under the same hypothesis;
3° the price in terms of wheat of the gold franc as a commodity 
and as money, supposing gold only serves as money;
4° the price in terms of wheat of the silver franc as a commodity, 
under the same hypothesis;
5° the price in terms of wheat of the silver franc and of the gold 
franc as a commodity and as money, supposing silver and gold both 
serve as money.
If we refer to our foregoing explanations and to our Figure 30, we 
will see that at the beginning, that is, at time zero, the irst quantity, 
p″, represented by op′′, is the root of the equation
q p H

= Fa ( ″) + p″ ;
the second one, π′ , represented by oπ′, is the root of
ωQo = ω Fo (ω π′);
the third one, π″ , represented by oπ″, is the root of
ω
π ω ωπ

Qo = H o

″ + F ( ″);
the fourth one, p′, represented by op′, is the root of
Qa = Fa (p′);


Relative stability of the value of the bimetallic standard 407
and, inally, the ith, P, represented by oP, is the root of
Q Q P H

a + ω o = Fa ( ) = P + ωFo (ωP).
Hence starting from the origin in Fig. 32, we measure the lengths 
op″, oπ′, oπ″, op′, and oP on the vertical axis op.
Ater a irst interval of time, the quantities Qa, Qo, and H, and the 
functions Fa and Fo having changed, the same magnitudes will be 
p1′′, π1′, π1′′, p1′, P1 , represented by the lengths 1p1′′, 1π1′, 1π1′′, 1p1′, 
1P1 indicated on the parallel to the vertical axis passing through the 
point 1 of the horizontal axis.
Ater a second interval of time, these magnitudes will be p2′′, π2′, 
π2′′, p2′ , P2, represented by the lengths 2p2′′, 2π2′, 2π2′′, 2p2′ , 2P2 indi-
cated on the parallel to the vertical axis passing through the point 2 
of the horizontal axis.
And so forth. In this way, we get the following ive curves:
1° he curve p′′p1′′p2′′ of the variation of the price of the silver 
franc as a commodity and as money on the hypothesis of the silver 
standard. It results analytically from the equation
Q p H

a = Fa ( ″) + p″
in which Qa and H are independent variables, the function Fa varies, 
and p′′ is a dependent variable instead of being a determined value;
2° he curve π′ π1′ π2′ of the variation of the price of the gold 
franc as a commodity on the same hypothesis of silver monometal-
lism. It results analytically from the equation
ωQo = ωFo (ωπ′)
in which Qo is an independent variable, the function Fo varies, and 
π′ is a dependent variable instead of being a determined value;


408 heory of money
3° he curve π′′π1′′π2′′ of the variation of the price of the gold 
franc as a commodity and as money on the hypothesis of gold mono-
metallism. It results from the equation
ω
π ω ωπ

Qo = H + o ″

′′ F ( )
in which Qo and H are independent variables, the function Fo varies, 
and π″ is a dependent variable;
4° he curve p′ p1′ p2′ of the variation of the price of the silver 
franc as a commodity on the same hypothesis of gold monometal-
lism. It results from the equation
Qa = Fa ( p′)
in which Qa is an independent variable, the function Fa varies, and p′ 
is a dependent variable;
5° Finally, the curve PP1P2 of the variation of the common price 
of the silver franc and the gold franc as a commodity and as money 
on the hypothesis of bimetallism. It results from the equation
Q Q P H

a + ω o = Fa ( ) + P + ωFo (ωP)
in which Qa , Qo and H are independent variables, the functions Fa 
and Fo vary, and P is a dependent variable.
he discussion of the curves 1, 3, and 5 will give us the conclusion 
we looked for on the respective advantages of monometallism and 
bimetallism from the point of view of the stability of the monetary 
standard.
For the sake of simplicity, we have made abstraction in our igure 
from variations in the value of H, and from changes of the functions 
Fa and Fo; and we have assumed variations in the quantities Qa and 
ωQo only in the way indicated in Figure 33 by the curves A and B, 
where the quantities of silver money are represented by the curve 
AA45 above the horizontal axis, and the quantities of gold by BB45 
under the axis. our conclusions, however, will be completely inde-
pendent of this restriction.

333. First of all, we must point to the similarity of the two curves 
p′′p1′′p2′′ and p′p1′ p2′ on the one hand, and of π′′π1′′π2′′ and 
π′π1′π2′ on the other hand. his similarity is understandable. he 
price of a metal that is at the same time a commodity and money is 
always greater than the price when the same metal is only a com-
modity since attributing to it the function of serving as money will 
have as a result the diminution of the quantity reserved for industrial 
usage and for luxury goods. Moreover, this adoption of a metal as 
money, which raises its price, increases also the variations in its price, 
without changing its nature in general. Hence the curve p′′p1′′p2′′ is 
both similar to and at the same time lies above the curve p′p1′p2′, 
and the curve π′′π1′′π2′′ is both similar to and at the same time lies 
above π′π1′π2′.
334. Having posited this, let us now return to Figure 30, and let us 
see why bimetallism is practicable from the outset. his is because, if 
only silver were money, the silver franc would take a value p″ given 
by the equation

Relative stability of the value of the bimetallic standard 411
and the gold franc a value π′ given by the equation
ωQo = ωFo (ωπ′);
and because p″>π′, it would be advantageous to transform gold 
francs as a commodity into gold francs as money, which would lead 
to a fall of the value of the silver franc as money compared to the 
silver franc as a commodity and to a transformation of silver money 
into silver as a commodity; and because, if only gold were money, the 
gold franc would take a value π″ given by the equation
ω
π ω ωπ

Qo = H o

″ + F ( ″),
and the silver franc a value p′ given by the equation
Qo = Fa ( p′);
and because π″ > p′, it would be advantageous to transform silver 
francs as a commodity into silver francs as money, which would lead 
to a fall of the value of the gold franc as money compared to the gold 
franc as a commodity and to a transformation of gold money into 
gold as a commodity.
Hence: – Bimetallism is only practicable on the condition that the 
price of the silver franc as a commodity and as money is greater than 
the price of the gold franc that is only a commodity, and that the price 
of the gold franc as a commodity and as money is greater than the 
price of the silver franc that is only merchandise; that is to say that 
the curve p′′p1′′p2′′ (Fig. 32) lies above the curve π′π1′π2′ and the 
curve π′′π1′′π2′′ lies above the curve p′p1′ p2′. In our igure, this 
takes place during the irst 10 time intervals, then from 15 to 25, then 
from 35 to 40.
335. he common price P of the silver franc both as a commodity 
and money and of the gold franc both as a commodity and money is 
given by the equation
Q Q P H

a + ω o = Fa ( ) + P + ωFo (ωP);


412 heory of money

and we have, on the one hand
Fa P + H > a >Fa

P Q P

( ) ( ),
and also, on the other hand,
H
P + ωFo (ωP) > ωQo > ωFo (ωP),
since the total quantity Qa of silver, and the total quantity Qo of gold 
are both partly commodities, for the quantities Qa′ and Qo′, and in part 
money, for the quantities Qa′′ and Qo′′, the irst inequality, moreover, 
evidently leads to the second, and vice versa.
Now, we have Q p p H
 p

a = a ′ = a ″ +

F ( ) F ( ) ″ ;

and

ω ω ωπ

π ω ωπ

Qo = o ′ = H o

F ( ) ″ + F ( ″).
We have therefore also
Fa P + H >Fa +

P p

H
( ) ( ′′) p′′ ,
which assumes p″ > P, and
Fa ( p′) > Fa (P),
which assumes P > p′. And we have, moreover,
H
P P

H

which assumes π′′>P, and
ωFo (ωπ′) > ωFo (ωP),


Relative stability of the value of the bimetallic standard 413
which assumes P>π′ .
Hence: – When bimetallism is the monetary system, the common 
price of the silver franc as a commodity and as money, and of the gold 
franc as a commodity and as money is both less than the price of the 
silver franc as a commodity and as money, and greater than the price 
of the gold franc only as a commodity, under silver monometallism; 
and it is also at the same time less than the price of the gold franc as 
a commodity and as money, and greater than the price of the silver 
franc only as a commodity, under gold monometallism; that is to say 
that the curve PP1P2  lies at the same time under the two curves 
p′′p1′′p2′′ and π′′π1′′π2′′ and above the two curves π′π1′π2′ and 
p′p1′p2′. his is still the case in our igure for the same time inter-
vals as above.
336. Let us go back once more to Figure 30, and see how bimetal-
lism changes into monometallism. It changes into silver monometal-
lism when Qa becomes equal to or greater than π′µ′, or when ωQo 
becomes equal to or less than m″n″ . It changes into gold monomet-
allism when ωQo becomes equal to or greater than m′n′ , or when Qa 
becomes equal to or less than π″µ″ . In the two irst cases, the price 
p″ of the silver franc is given by the equation
Q p H

a = Fa ( ″)+ p″ ,
and the price π′ of the gold franc by
ωQo = ωFo (ωπ′).
However, if p″ is equal to or less than π′, there is no advantage in 
transforming gold as a commodity into gold as money. In the two last 
cases, the price π″ of the gold franc is given by the equation
ω
π ω ωπ

Qo = H o

″ + F ( ″),
and the price p′ of the silver franc by the equation
Qa = Fa (p′).


414 heory of money
However, if π″ is equal to or less than π′, there is no advantage in 
transforming silver as a commodity into silver as money.
Hence: – Bimetallism changes into silver monometallism as soon as 
the price of the gold franc only as a commodity becomes greater than 
the price of the silver franc as a commodity and as money; that is to say 
when the curve π′π1′π2′ lies above the curve p″p1′′p2′′ as is the 
case during the 5 time intervals from 10 to 15 in Figure 32. It changes 
into gold monometallism as soon as the price of the silver franc only 
as a commodity becomes greater than the price of the gold franc as a 
commodity and as money; that is to say when the curve p′p1′p2′ lies 
above the curve π″π1′′π2′′ as is the case during the 10 time intervals 
from 25 to 35.
Furthermore, it is evident that: – When bimetallism changes into 
silver monometallism or into gold monometallism, there is no longer a 
common price of the silver franc and the gold franc. he curve PP1P2 
will be interrupted.
337. In circumstances such as those to which our Figure 32 
corresponds, the result of the substitution of bimetallism for sil-
ver monometallism during the period 0–45 would have been 
to substitute, in place of the curve p p1 p2 p

′′ π′′ as the graph of the variation 
of the value in terms of corn of the numeraire and monetary stand-
ard. he result of the substitution of bimetallism by gold monomet-
allism would have been the substitution of the same curve by the 
curve π″π1′′π2′′ π′′

 45 . he circumstances corresponding to our igure 
have undoubtedly no relation to reality, the less so because we have 
made abstraction of certain elements, among which are the vari-
ation in the magnitude of the desired cash balance and the changes 
of the utility of the precious metals considered as commodities, 
which would have increased or decreased the efects of the varia-
tions in their quantity; but it is no less certain that the curve PP1P2 
undergoes phases of rising and of falling that are less considerable 
than those of the curves p p1 p2 p

″ ′′ ′′ ′45

 ′ and π″π1′′π2′′ π′′

 45 because it 
always lies below these two curves and only coincides with the lower 
of the two as soon as the other tends to rise appreciably in relation 
to the lower one. his curve PP1P2 is remarkably horizontal in 
our example, which is caused by our hypothesis that the quantities 


Relative stability of the value of the bimetallic standard 415

of silver and gold vary in general in opposite directions; neverthe-
less, such as it is, it enables us very well to recognize the limits of the 
compensating efect of bimetallism.
Let us irst complete Figure 33 by means of the two curves A′A′45 
and B′B′45, relating to the bimetallic system; the irst curve divides 
the total quantity of silver francs into silver francs as a commod-
ity and silver francs as money, where the former are measured by 
the upper part of the ordinate, between the curves A and A′ , and 
the latter on the lower part, between the curve A′ and the horizon-
tal axis. he second curve divides the total quantity of gold francs 
into gold francs as a commodity and gold francs as money, where 
the latter are measured by the upper part of the ordinate, between 
the horizontal axis and the curve B′ , and the former on the lower 
part, between the curves B′ and B. Now, other things remaining 
unchanged, it may happen that, when the quantity of one of the met-
als increases or decreases, the quantity of the other metal decreases 
or increases by the same amount, in such a way that the total quantity 
of silver francs and gold francs remains the same, and that, more-
over, the quantity of gold francs as a commodity, the quantity of sil-
ver francs as a commodity, and the total quantity of gold francs and 
silver francs remains also the same; thus, it is only the proportion 
of gold francs and of silver francs as money that changes; this takes 
place during the period 15–25. In this case, bimetallism is always 
practicable, and, consequently, the ratio of the value of gold as a com-
modity to the value of silver as a commodity is maintained at ω in 
the market. Moreover, the quantity of money neither increases nor 
decreases, and, consequently, the money prices of the commodities 
neither rise nor fall. However, irst, and even in the event that one of 
the two metals becomes abundant or rare while the other becomes 
rare or abundant, it can happen that the abundant metal drives the 
rare metal completely out of the monetary circulation and furnishes 
alone more or fewer francs than were furnished before by the two 
metals taken together, as takes place during the period 10–15 and 
during the period 25–35. In this case, bimetallism changes into 
monometallism, and, consequently, the ratio of the value of gold 
as a commodity to the value of silver as a commodity rises above 
or decreases below ω in the market. Furthermore, the quantity of 
money increases or decreases, and, therefore, an increase or a fall of 


416 heory of money

the money prices of the commodities will occur. Second, it can also 
happen that, when the quantity of one of the two metals increases or 
decreases, the quantity of the other metal increases or decreases at 
the same time, so that the two metals, gold and silver, will still func-
tion in the monetary circulation, but furnish together more or fewer 
francs than they did before, as happens at the beginning of the period 
0–10 and at the end of the period 35–45. In this case, bimetallism 
is still practicable, and, therefore, the ratio of the value of gold as a 
commodity to the value of silver as a commodity is maintained at ω 
in the market, but the quantity of money increases or decreases, and, 
as a consequence, the money prices of the commodities rise or fall.
Hence: – he bimetallic standard keeps a certain stability with respect 
to value in the cases in which the monometallic standards would have 
varied in opposite directions. It varies just as much as the monometallic 
standards when they vary in the same direction.
To summarize, from the point of view of the stability of the monet-
ary standard, bimetallism entrusts itself to chance, just as monomet-
allism does; it has only somewhat more favorable chances.
338. he curve P P10P15P25P35P45 has been glimpsed and pointed out in 
the controversies between economists on the subject of bimetallism. 
It is this curve that the late W. Stanley Jevons wanted to present and 
believed he had done so in Chapter XII, ‘he battle of standards’, of 
his Money and the Mechanism of Exchange.i Jevons’s curve has oten 
been referred to and reproduced conidently by the bimetallists. But 
there is, between the curve P, deduced mathematically from the con-
dition of the value of money, and Jevons’s curve D, empirically based, 
a noteworthy diference. he curve P sometimes difers from the two 
curves p″ and π″ below which it lies, as it does, for example, from P 
to P10, from P15 to P25, and from P35 to P45. In certain circumstances 
only, will it coincide with the one or the other of those two curves: 
for example, it coincides with the curve p″ from P10 to P15, and with 
π″ from P25 to P35. Jevons’s curve D coincides always with the one 
of the two curves p″ and π″ that lies below the other. In our igure, 
this would be a curve p CDP p

′ 10 11

′′ . his position of Jevons’s curve 
corresponds to the hypothesis, quite clearly expounded in his text, 
that the bimetallic system is essentially a system with an alternative 
standard in the sense that it never accepts more than one metal in 


Relative stability of the value of the bimetallic standard 417

circulation: sometimes gold, sometimes silver. Now, it is certain that 
this is an error. our reasoning has established and experience shows 
that bimetallism is practicable; and, in that case, the common and 
identical value of the gold franc and the silver franc is necessarily 
less than the value that the gold franc would have had under gold 
monometallism and than that of the silver franc under silver mono-
metallism. his example demonstrates the importance of proceeding 
methodically in these questions of quantitative relationships that do 
not tolerate the least vagueness.
his error having been rectiied, it remains none the less true, as 
Jevons recognized, that bimetallism certainly has a compensatory 
action. I do not want to return to the fact that this action results 
from a perpetual monetization and demonetization of metal; but I 
will make a inal observation to the bimetallists.
339. Supposing that we undertake to introduce, in the applied theory 
of money, the consideration of the greater or lesser stability of the 
value of the monetary standard, why content ourselves with an erratic 
and imperfect stability and not aim at a sure and perfect stability? Let 
us investigate whether wheat fulills, under certain reservations, the 
conditions of a commodity with a rareté and a value that are appre-
ciably constant. Let us investigate whether the rareté and the value of 
money must be constant, or whether it would not be better that these 
magnitudes vary with the average rareté and average value of social 
wealth; and let us substitute in place of wheat some multiple stand-
ard to be determined. In all these arrangements, the bimetallic curve 
P would be closer to horizontality than the monometallic curves p″ 
and π″; but, instead of adhering to the use of the curve P, why not 
look for the horizontality itself by means of an action performed with 
full knowledge of the quantity of metal in circulation? his is what 
we would achieve, not by bimetallism, but by gold monometallism 
combined with a silver token, distinct from coins for small change, 
to be introduced into the circulation or withdrawn from it in such 
a way that the value of the multiple standard would not vary. he 
State, which would execute this operation, would beneit from the  
emission and lose on the withdrawal, and the diference between 
the loss and the proit would be added to or deducted from the cost of 
minting and demonetizing, to constitute the price the society would 


418 heory of money

pay for the stability or the regularity of the variation of the monetary 
standard. However, we shall return further onii to these questions of 
applied and practical economics; for the moment, it will suice us 
to have established the most important suppress points of the pure 
theory of money.

Notes
i New york: D. Appleton and Co, 1876. he igure to which Walras alluded 
is the following (Money and the Mechanism of Exchange, chapter 12, end of 
the ith section, titled ‘Compensatory Action’):

Jevons wrote:
In the irst place, it does not follow that the prices of commodities follow the 
extreme luctuations of value of both metals, as many writers have inconsider-
ately declared. Prices only depend upon the course of the metal which happens 
to have sunk in value below the legal ratio of 15½ to 1. Now, if in the accom-
panying igure we represent by the line A the variation of the value of gold as 
estimated in terms of some third commodity, say copper, and by the line B the 
corresponding variations of the value of silver; then, superposing these curves, 
the line C would be the curve expressing the extreme luctuations of both met-
als. Now the standard of value always follows the metal which falls in value; 
hence the curve D really shows the course of variation of the standard of value. 
his line undergoes more frequent undulations than either of the curves of gold 
or silver, but the luctuations do not proceed to so great an extent, a point of 
much greater importance. (Money and the Mechanism of Exchange, chapter 12, 
fourth section)

LESSON 36

Fiduciary money and ofsetting claims. 
Foreign exchange

SUMMARy: – Diverse means to settle exchanges without the 
intervention of metallic money: Book credit; Commercial paper; 
Bank notes; Checks. Deinitive equation of monetary circulation.
Circulation of bills of exchange. Rate of currency exchange. 
Exchange rate properly so called. Parity, loss, premium. Payments 
achieved by drawing up and remittance of bills of exchange. 
Determination of the rate of exchange. Limit to the loss or pre-
mium of exchange. Equation of exchange rate. General equilib-
rium of exchange rates. Arbitrage. Result of arbitrages.
340. It is a curious fact of the theory of money, quite worthy of being 
pointed out, that using money was irst considered progress, and that, 
once it was introduced, doing without it was considered the next step 
forward. here are, indeed, some ways of making exchanges without 
the intervention of metallic money, and the importance of them is 
growing from day to day. hese ways are the following.
341. Book credit. X and y are two traders who buy and sell commod-
ities reciprocally on credit. At certain times, as, for example, at the 
end of each semester, the total amount that X owes to y, and the total 
amount that y owes to X are calculated, and it is seen which of the 
two debts is the greater. only the diference is paid in money; most 
oten, however, the diference is carried over in the books. In this 
way, some rare payments in money suice to settle a long sequence 
of very considerable sales and purchases.
So, there is here a certain quantity of exchanges that have been 
efectuated without the intervention of metallic money; however, the 


Fiduciary money and ofsetting claims 421

transactions assume the invention and the existence of the numer-
aire and of money; and if the precious metals are absent in fact, they 
are always present in principle. It is thanks to the existence of the 
numeraire that the bookkeeping of debit and credit can be done; it 
is thanks to the existence of money that each trade between X and 
y can be considered as a complete, deinitive exchange operation 
needing nothing more than to be settled in detail by handing over 
coins, and that it was possible to consider X and y as leaving to each 
other the disposal of the coins owed to each other and of which they 
were the owners. here is more: the units of loan could be compared, 
that is to say, the products of units of money lent out times the units 
of time during which the loan is outstanding, and take exactly into 
account, at the occasion of settlement, the diference between the 
credit granted by X to y and that granted by y to X; and this latter 
operation would always have been impossible without the interven-
tion, not real but virtual, of the numeraire and of money.
342. Commercial paper. It does not always happen, it happens even 
quite rarely that two traders carry out business with each other that 
is extensive enough and frequent enough to keep such an account 
with each other. In that case, and when, for example, X has placed an 
isolated order with y, then either at the same time, or ater a certain 
period of book credit, the transaction will be settled as follows. If X 
and y live in the same town, X will make out a promissory note to y 
in these terms: ‘At such and such date, I shall pay to y, or to his order, 
such and such an amount, having received that value in commod-
ities. Signed X.’ If X and y do not live in the same town, y will draw 
a bill of exchange on X in these terms: ‘At such and such date, pay to 
my order such and such an amount, having received that value in 
commodities. Signed y.’ his bill of exchange will be accepted by X 
in these terms: ‘Accepted. Signed X.’ It is certain that, at the due date, 
X, while paying his note or y’s drat, will pay with coins; but before 
that time, the following will have happened. y, once in possession 
of the promissory note or the accepted bill of exchange, may have 
used it to settle a transaction with a third merchant Z. He may have 
handed over the note or the drat to Z, endorsing it in these terms: 
‘Pay to Z, or to his order, such or such amount, value on account. 
Signed y.’ Z himself may have used the paper by endorsing it in his 


422 heory of money

turn to a fourth party W for settling some transaction. So, it is pos-
sible that, from the moment of its creation to that of its expiry, the 
paper has served to settle two, three, four, ive, ten, twenty sales and 
purchases of commodities. If, at the date of expiry, X did not pay, the 
paper would return from endorser to endorser and inally to y; but if 
X does pay, everything is inished, and the twenty transactions have 
been settled with one single paying out of coins.
Here again the existence of the numeraire and of money is neces-
sary, and their virtual, if not real, intervention. Each of the endorsers 
is assumed to leave X in the possession of the coins that belong to 
him (the endorser) all the time during which he keeps the paper, and 
each of them receives, in the form of a part of the interest paid by X, 
a remuneration for this service.
343. Banknotes. he circulation of promissory notes and bills of 
exchange has the disadvantage that they are payable only at the due 
date, that is, ater a certain interval of time, and there is a risk that 
the maker of the drat or the acceptor becomes insolvent during that 
period; moreover, because they are transmissible by endorsement 
only, each endorser has the obligation of reimbursing the entire sum, 
should the necessity arise, with the possibility of not being reimbursed 
himself. here are institutions called issuing banks that then perform 
the following operation. hey accept commercial paper payable ater 
a ixed term and transmissible only by endorsement, and replace it by 
notes payable on demand, transmissible without endorsement, that 
are called banknotes. Such is the banknote: basically, it is a bill pay-
able at sight to the bearer, substituted for a bill payable at maturity. 
Just because one can, if one so wishes, from one moment to another, 
go to the bank to exchange them for coins, and because they are 
transmitted without endorsement or liability, these notes circulate 
much more easily than commercial paper: the very fact that they are 
due for payment by all the holders is the reason that the holders let 
them pass from hand to hand. In this way, the banknote remains 
in circulation at least until the maturity of the commercial paper it 
has replaced; the bank then presents the paper for collection and 
receives its own banknote or, when it is lacking, coins that it keeps 
until the presentation of the bank note that had remained in circu-
lation. herefore, it suices that the total of commercial paper in the 


Fiduciary money and ofsetting claims 423

bank’s portfolio and the coins in till are equal to the amount of bank-
notes in circulation; that is to say that with a certain amount of cash, 
a bank can have two, three, four, ive times more banknotes in circu-
lation. In the part on Credit, in the applied theory of the Production 
of wealth, we will study in detail the conditions of the functioning 
of this phenomenon; for the time being, we accept the fact as such 
and from the point of view of its consequences with respect to the 
use and the value of the metallic currency. Now, it is evident that, if 
the bank’s cash reserves amount to 100 million and the circulation 
of its banknotes to 300 million, the two-thirds of transactions set-
tled by banknotes are made, not independently of the numeraire and 
money, but without actual use of precious metal and, in reality, they 
are achieved by means of commercial paper.
344. Checks. X, y, Z, and W do not have an account the one with the 
other; they do not make out promissory notes to each other, nor do 
they furnish each other bills of exchange; they do not make use of 
banknotes, either; here is how they act. Each of them has a banker 
with whom they deposit a certain amount of money, commercial 
papers, or banknotes, which constitute a reserve. hey draw upon this 
reserve by means of checks, which are receipts drawn on the banker 
and by means of which they pay for their various purchases. If mat-
ters were restricted to this, the reserve would soon be exhausted; but 
there is something else. When X, y, Z, and W make purchases, they 
also make sales, and they receive checks themselves in the payments 
for the commodities, drawn either on their own banker, or on other 
bankers in the town. As and when they receive checks, they take them 
to their banker to be added to their reserve, and they dispose of this 
extra reserve by writing other checks, just as they did with respect 
to their original reserve. his is still not all. here is, in the town, an 
institution called a clearing house (chambre de liquidation) where all 
the bankers meet every day. here each of them hands over to the 
other bankers the checks that he has that are drawn on them and 
receives from them the checks that they have that are drawn on him. 
As for the diference, he pays or receives it in specie; that is to say, the 
excess of what he owes over what is due to him or what is due to him 
over what he owes. In this way, checks can be created for an amount 
quite superior to that of the original reserves. his means that checks 


424 heory of money

form a powerful means of settling sales and purchases without the 
actual use of metallic money, in particular in combination with the 
clearing house, which is the crowning achievement of the system. 
Similarly, in the clearing houses of London and New york business 
amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds or dollars is settled by 
means of the use of some thousands of pounds or dollars in specie.
345. Commercial paper and banknotes together constitute the whole 
of the iduciary or paper money, in contrast to metallic money. We 
have already identiied the equation of the metallic circulation (§§ 
321 and 324); it is useful to complete this equation by introducing 
a term relating to the iduciary money. Let F be the amount of this 
iduciary money, and let us introduce this term, alongside the one 
representing the amount of metallic money, into the irst term of the 
equation of the money circulation. With respect to the payment by 
means of book credit, transfers of specie, or with checks, it must be 
admitted that as and when these practices are increasingly used, the 
desired cash balance becomes progressively smaller, but that, at a 
given moment, the cash balance is what it is because of the transac-
tions that are to be settled in money, abstraction being made from 
ofsetting claims, or, more exactly stated, ofsetting claims being 
taken fully into account.
As we said, the introduction of the term F into our equation yields 
in general
(Qa′′+ F) = H;
and it remains to be seen, if the quantity Qa′′ on the one hand, and, on 
the other hand, the money prices rise or fall proportionally, whether 
the term F would automatically increase or decrease proportion-
ally, and whether H would remain constant. It takes only a moment 
of relection about this to be convinced that those phenomena will 
occur. Indeed, as we have seen (§ 321), all the essential conditions 
of the four equilibriums, of exchange, production, capital formation, 
and circulation, being fulilled, if the rise or fall of the prices are pro-
portional to the increase or decrease of the quantity of money, then 
there is no reason why the entrepreneur would not bring the same 
quantity of capital into the circulation for an amount proportionally 


Fiduciary money and ofsetting claims 425

greater or smaller of commercial papers and banknotes, in order that 
the same quantities of commodities will be sold and bought for an 
amount that is nominally greater or smaller. So, the two facts of cir-
culation and compensation do not undermine in the least the the-
orem of the proportionality of prices and the quantity of money.
Let it be clearly noted that I fully admit that, if, from one moment 
to another, all the data of the problem change, there will no longer 
be the necessary relation of proportionality between the quantity of 
money and prices; if, for example, the quantity of metallic money 
diminishes, and paper money replaces the metallic money more and 
more, or if ofsetting claims come more and more into use, prices 
would remain unchanged instead of falling; but I maintain that 
if, at a given moment or from one moment to another and while 
other things remain unchanged, the quantity of money increases or 
decreases, prices rise or fall in proportion. If my demonstration is 
refuted, I will accept that; but using purely and simply the data of the 
ofsetting claims made in the clearing houses of London and New 
york to conclude that ‘we no longer live in the time in which there 
was a correlation between the quantity of the precious metals and the 
prices’, is to show an absence of any idea of the way in which a quan-
tity that is a function of several variables can depend on each of these 
variables in particular.
346. Banknotes circulate nearly exclusively within the country of 
their issue; the circulation of bills of exchange is much wider. From 
all places in Europe, East India, America, bills of exchange are drawn 
on Paris and London, and they pass through an endless number of 
hands to settle various and numerous sales and purchases before 
being presented at the place where they must be paid. Consequently, 
bills of exchange are of exceptional importance as a part of iduciary 
money. he great centers of commerce and banking: London, Paris, 
Amsterdam, Hamburg, Genoa, Trieste, New york, each have markets 
where bills of exchange are bought and sold. In each of these mar-
kets, letters of exchange are quoted against all the others: this is what 
is called the exchange rate or the exchange. In Paris, the exchange 
rate on London, Amsterdam, Frankfort, Trieste are quoted: for 
example: – ‘To-day, in Paris, the exchange rate on London is 25.15, 
on Amsterdam 208.25, on Frankfort 210, on Trieste 195.50.’ hat is 


426 heory of money

to say that 1 pound sterling payable in London is bought and sold 
in Paris for 25.15 Fr, that 100 guilders payable in Amsterdam, or in 
Frankfort, or in Trieste, are bought and sold in Paris for 208.25 Fr., 
210 Fr., 195.50 Fr. From this we see that for there to be an exchange 
rate there must be two terms: a certain term that is implicit, that is 
1 pound sterling, 100 guilders, and an uncertain term that is expli-
cit, that is 208.25 Fr., 210 Fr., 195.50 Fr. In the above exchange rates, 
London, Amsterdam, Frankfort, Trieste furnish the certain term, 
Paris the uncertain term.
347. In the establishment of these exchange rates, there is an element 
due to the diference of the moneys, and there is an element due to 
the exchange properly speaking. hus, 1 pound sterling contains just 
as much gold as there is in a piece that is 25.22 Fr. If, therefore, the 
exchange rate of Paris on London is 25.22, this exchange is at par: 
any amount whatsoever of gold would have the same value either 
in London, or in Paris. he diference between the exchange rate of 
22.15 in the example above and the par of 25.22 is then the exchange 
properly speaking. he matter becomes simpler, and the exchange 
properly speaking more apparent, if the moneys are the same. So, if 
the exchange rate of Paris on Brussels is 101, on Genoa 95, then this 
means that 100 francs payable in Brussels are bought for 101 francs 
in Paris, that 100 Italian liras are bought for 95 francs in Paris.i In 
this case, Brussels is above par or stands at a premium, and Genoa is 
below par or stands at a discount.
he exchange rate is therefore generally the price at one place of 
an amount payable at another place. What are the causes that make 
an amount payable at the latter place have a higher or a lower value 
than at the former one? his is what we have to investigate. To do 
so, we will see under what conditions the trade in commercial paper 
takes place.
348. Payments from one place to another normally take place by 
means of the remittance of bills of exchange and not by sending 
metallic money. X, a merchant in London, has sold merchandise to 
y, a merchant in Paris. on the other hand, Z, a merchant in Paris, has 
sold merchandise to W, a merchant in London for an amount that we 
may assume to be equal to the irst one. Under these circumstances, 


Fiduciary money and ofsetting claims 427

it is useless for y to send gold or silver from Paris to X in London, 
and for W in London to send gold or silver to Z in Paris. he two pay-
ments can be carried out without the intervention of metallic money, 
by drawing and remitting two bills of exchange, and here is how this 
happens. Let X in London draw on y in Paris; if W in London buys 
the bill of exchange, X will be paid and W will have paid. Let W remit 
that same bill of exchange to Z in Paris; when Z has cashed the bill of 
exchange with y in Paris, Z will be paid and y will have paid. hus, 
the two debts will be cancelled and the two credit lines reimbursed.
349. hat is the principle; let us go to the application, and, for the 
sake of simplicity, assume two places use the same currency. Various 
merchants in Brussels have sold merchandise to various merchants in 
Paris for an amount of 101,000 francs And, on the other hand, several 
merchants in Paris have sold merchandise to merchants in Brussels 
for 100,000 francs In accordance with what has been said before, it 
is useless for 101,000 francs in silver or gold to be sent from Paris 
to Brussels, and for 100,000 francs to be sent from Brussels to Paris. 
Assume that the creditors in Brussels furnish bills on Paris amount-
ing to 101,000 francs and sell the entire lot for 100,000 francs to the 
debtors in Brussels on behalf of the debtors in Paris; or that the cred-
itors in Paris furnish 100,000 francs in bills of exchange on Brussels 
and sell the entire lot for 101,000 francs to the debtors in Paris on 
behalf of the creditors in Brussels; or that the operation takes place 
partly in the irst way, partly in the second, in proportional fractions, 
in such a manner that no debtor, whether in Brussels or in Paris, can 
gain an advantage by buying a drat rather than having one drawn 
on him. In any case, 101 francs payable in Paris is worth 100 francs 
payable in Brussels, and the exchange rate of Paris on Brussels will 
be 100

101, expressed as 99.01; 100 francs payable in Brussels are worth 
101 francs in Paris, and the exchange rate of Brussels on Paris will 
be 101

100, expressed as 101. he debtors in Paris will send 1000 francs 
to Brussels, because their creditors have the right to be paid in full, 
even if this must be done by sending metallic money; moreover, they 


428 heory of money

will sufer from the discount in the exchange; the debtors in Brussels 
will beneit, in principle, from the premium of the corresponding 
exchange rate.
350. But, it will be said, if Paris owes 200,000 francs to Brussels, whereas 
Brussels owes only 100,000 to Paris, the respective exchange rates of 
Paris on Brussels and Brussels on Paris would then be 100

200 and 

200
100 ; 
in other words, 200 francs payable in Paris would be worth 100 francs 
in Brussels, and 100 francs payable in Brussels would be worth 200 
francs in Paris! No: that absurd consequence is not possible. here is 
a limit to the discount and the premium of the exchange: this limit 
is the total cost of the transport, risks included, of 100 francs in spe-
cie from the one place to the other. As long as the discount in the 
exchange does not reach this limit, the debtor prefers to buy a drat 
or let one be drawn on him rather than sending specie. If the limit is 
reached, he is indiferent between the two procedures. If the limit is 
exceeded, he would prefer sending specie; hence the limit cannot be 
exceeded.
351. In his Recherches sur les principles mathématiques de la théorie 
des richesses, Cournot devoted a special chapter to foreign exchange.ii 
I permit myself to refer the reader to this chapter for fuller details, 
and I will restrict myself here to borrowing the notation used by that 
author to furnish the general formula of exchange.
Let (1) and (2) be two centers of exchange; m1,2 is the sum of the 
amounts that locality (1) owes to locality (2), m2,1 is the sum of the 
amounts that locality (2) owes to locality (1), c1,2 is the exchange rate

Hence: – he exchange rates are equal to the inverse ratios of the

hey are reciprocals of each other.
We recognize the reappearance of the ratios of the prices (§ 44), 
which are as they should be inasmuch as the exchange rates are, by 
deinition, the prices in each locality of a unit or of a certain quantity 
of money payable in all the other places.

is applicable to two countries with the same money, gold money, for 
example. In this case, the merchant who has to make a remittance 
from place (1) on place (2), and who has at his disposal the necessary 
gold to carry out this remittance, buys a drat if

oretically and practically, in many cases, it could be important to dis-
tinguish these two factors of which one, relating to the ratio of the 
respective debts and claims of the two places, is the exchange rate 
properly speaking, and of which the other, relating to the ratio of the 
value of the two moneys, could be called the agio.
hat having been said, if place (2) has a money that is convertible 
into the money of place (1), for example, silver money convertible 
into gold, then the merchant has silver at his disposal. He buys a bill

here is therefore a variable limit here to the exchange rate. But 
if place (2) has a money that is not convertible into the money of 
place (1), for example, a paper money in the form of legal tender, the 
merchant has paper at his disposal that he cannot send in any case. 
Whatever m

 and p1,2 are, he must buy either a drat or gold. hen 
there is no limit to the exchange.
353. Let (1), (2), (3), (4),  be an indeinite number of centers of 
exchange, c2,1 and c3,1 the exchanges rates of places (2) and (3) on 
place (1), c3,2 the exchanges rate of place (3) on place (2); by a reason-
ing identical to that used in the case of the exchange of several goods 
among one another in a market (§ 111), it can be demonstrated that 
there cannot be a general equilibrium among the exchange rates 
unless we have, in general,

Hence – In the situation of general equilibrium, the exchange rate 
of any one place on another is equal to the ratio of the exchange rates 
between each of the two places on any third place.
354. When general equilibrium does not exist, it will be brought 
about by arbitrages, carried out on bills of exchange, exactly the 
same as the arbitrages that we have assumed to be carried out on 
any types of commodities (§ 113). he bills of exchange are precisely 
and par excellence the commodity on which arbitrages are made. In 
all the centers of commerce there are bankers, specializing as for-
eign exchange brokers, who are occupied daily by studies of the rates 
of exchange and who bring about the general equilibrium by bene-
itting from the substitution of indirect purchases in place of direct 
purchases, or, saying it better, by the combination of an indirect pur-
chase or sale with a direct sale or purchase. his intervention has two 
extremely important consequences.
355. A irst result of the arbitrages is that exchange from one place on 
each of the others is not determined by the simple ratio of the debts 
of that place to its credits on each of the other places, but depends, in 
a more complex way, on the ratio of the debts and the credits of that 
place to those of all the other places. In other words, the exchange 
rates of a country with the foreign countries vary simultaneously 
and in the same direction depending on whether the general results 
of the exchanges of this country with the foreign countries form an 
excess of the total value of the exports over that of the imports or an 
excess of the total value of the imports over that of the exports. When 
a country has sold more than it has bought, the exchange rate of its 
paperiii has a tendency to rise above par; when it has bought more 
than it has sold, its exchange rate has a tendency to fall below par. In 
the former system known as the balance of trade, this was expressed 
by saying that the foreign trade is for or against the country in ques-
tion, or that the balance is favorable or unfavorable. hese expressions 
relect the presumed advantage of the import of precious metals and 


432 heory of money

the disadvantage of their export. Ideas in this respect have changed 
notably; and yet, it is good to know that, depending on whether a 
country’s foreign trade balance is favorable or unfavorable, it imports 
or it exports money; in the irst case, this leads to a rise in prices 
and, consequently to an expansion of imports and a contraction 
of exports, and, in the second case, this leads to a fall in the prices 
and, consequently to a contraction of imports and an expansion of 
exports, so that in both cases, equilibrium tends to be reestablished 
automatically.
356. he second efect of the arbitrages made on bills of exchange, a 
practical result of immense importance, is that an enormous mass 
of international exchanges and services are settled by means of the 
smallest possible shipment of gold or silver. Until not long ago, the 
international contracts and their payments from country to coun-
try came nearly entirely from the export and import of commod-
ities, that is to say, agricultural, industrial, and commercial products. 
Nowadays, a considerable number of diverse elements enters into the 
composition of these debits and credits. he most important of these 
elements are summed up by Mr. George G. Goschen in his heory 
of Foreign Exchange;iv they are the following: import and export of 
public and industrial credit instruments, public and industrial secur-
ities, payment and collection of the arrears of these titles, payment of 
proits, commissions, and brokerage fees, expenditures made abroad 
by nationals, etc., etc. England, for example, has every year an excess 
of imports over exports of commodities properly speaking of several 
hundreds millions; it brings its balance into equilibrium by means 
of the charges for the freight carried by their shipping companies, 
the commissions and the brokerage fees on commercial and banking 
operations that it undertakes, incomes from the capital it possesses. 
his is the business settled by bills of exchange. Paris owes an excess 
to Brussels, but Amsterdam or Frankfort owes an excess to Paris; the 
irst excess is paid by the means of the second. So, the universal mar-
ket for exchange bills is like a vast clearing-house where the trades of 
the whole world are liquidated by the simple payments of diferences. 
And this result is obtained by the simple working of the mechanism 
of free competition let to itself. his is the law of supply and demand 
that regulates all these exchanges of commodities, like the law of the 


Fiduciary money and ofsetting claims 433

universal gravitation governs all the movements of the celestial bod-
ies. Here the system of the economic world inally appears in its full 
extent and complexity, and is seen to be just as beautiful, that is to say, 
both as vast and as simple, as the system of the astronomic world.v

PART VI

PRICE FIXING, MONOPOLY, AND 
TAXATION


437

LESSON 37

Price ixing and monopoly

SUMMARy: – Various modes of economic organization of soci-
ety other than free competition. Abstraction from second order 
efects. Maximum prices of productive services: the entrepreneurs 
cannot buy as much as they would like despite making proits; min-
imum prices of productive services: the owners of productive ser-
vices cannot sell as much as they would like. Maximum prices of 
products: the entrepreneurs decline to produce; minimum prices 
of products: they make a proit.
Monopoly consists of the fact that there is only one provider of a 
productive service or a product. he price increases, the demand, 
the output, or consumption decreases. Total product increases 
and decreases; maximum. Fixed expenses. he entrepreneurs 
intervene, in the case of monopoly, to take as proit a part of the 
wealth that is exchanged. Principle of Cournot’s analytic theory of 
monopoly.
Sale of various fractions of the total demand at the variety of 
prices that are, for each fraction, the maximum price. Partial gross 
products; total gross product; maximum. Partial expenses. Partial 
net products; total net product; maximum. he multiplicity of 
prices is much easier to maintain in the case of monopoly than 
in the case of free competition. he error in Dupuit’s mathemat-
ical theory of utility: the utility is not given by the area under the 
demand curve.
357. All our foregoing conclusions relate to a single and unique 
hypothesis: that of absolute free competition in exchange, produc-
tion, and capital formation. hus, what we have learned are the 


438 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

efects of free competition. But whatever economists may say, or 
what they seem to say, free competition is not the only possible sys-
tem of economic organization; there are others: those of regulation, 
price ixing, special privileges, monopolies, etc. To choose between 
free competition and the other systems, or, if we so wish, to prefer 
free competition over these other systems, and to do so in full aware-
ness of their causes, it is also necessary to know their efects. And, 
once again, even if there were no reason to apply that knowledge, it 
would still be necessary to study the natural and necessary efects of 
the various possible types of social organization, if only because of 
scientiic curiosity.
358. We have now to distinguish between restrictions on laisser faire, 
laisser passer in regard to production or circulation of wealth, and 
State intervention in regard to the distribution of wealth. In the irst 
category there are maximum and minimum prices, prohibitive and 
protective tarifs, monopolies, and the issuance of paper money; in 
the second are income taxes and iscal taxes. It can be seen what a 
variety of subjects are included in this part of economic theory, com-
pletely neglected these days and that will be developed progressively 
as a full and complete knowledge of the general case makes possible 
the study of all kinds of exceptions. We will take up here only some 
principal points in order to show the way to treat these questions, or 
because their clariication has relevance for the elaboration of basic 
applied and social economics.
It is unnecessary, moreover, when it is desired to take account 
of the various sorts of disruptions that can be introduced into the 
mechanism of free competition, to trace out these efects in their last 
details. Abstraction can be made from the variations that compen-
sate each other and from those that are accessory and very slight in 
comparison with the principal variations. In that respect, the price 
curves (§§ 225, 226) are very useful.
359. Let us assume that the price of a productive service or of a prod-
uct is regulated. here are two cases to be distinguished: one in which 
it is forbidden to sell the service or a product at a price higher than 
a certain ixed price that is less than the price that results from free 
competition, which is the case of the maximum; and one in which 


Price ixing and monopoly 439

it is forbidden to sell the service or a product at a price lower than 
a certain ixed price higher than the freely competitive price, which 
is the case of the minimum. It is, in practice, generally very diicult 
to enforce such prohibitions, but it is not impossible. And, further-
more, however that may be, what we have to examine here are the 
consequences of substituting an artiicial price in place of the natural 
price, considered apart from the ways and means of enforcing the 
substitution. We will examine the efects of price ixing successively 
on productive services and on products.
360. Let δt ( pt ), ωt (pt ) be the purchase and sales functions of the 
productive service (T) represented by the curves TdTp and MN 
(Fig. 34). he price of (T) being ixed at the maximum pt′ < pt, or at 
the minimum pt′′ > pt, the equality
δt ( pt ) = ωt ( pt )
would be replaced, in the irst case, by the inequality

represented by the greater height of the ordinate p′t T′ in comparison 
with the ordinate p′tt′ , so long as the rise in price that would result 
from the excess of efective demand over efective supply is ruled out; 
and, in the second case, by the inequality
δt ( pt′′) < ωt (pt′′),
represented by the lesser height of the ordinate p′t T″ in comparison 
with the ordinate p′t′t″, so long as the fall in price that would result 
from the excess of efective supply over efective demand is ruled out. 
In the case of the maximum, a certain number of entrepreneurs would 
be unable to purchase land services, or all the entrepreneurs would be 
unable to buy as much land service as they would like. Furthermore, 
a proit would be realized on the quantity purchased as a result of the 
price of the products being higher than their average cost. In the case 
of the minimum, a certain number of landowners would be unable 
to sell any land services, or all the landowners would not be able to 
sell as much as they would like. In the same way, if, for example, a 
maximum interest charge were established, the entrepreneurs would 
not be able to borrow as much capital as they would like, in spite 
of the proit they would make. And similarly, inally, if the State, by 
legislation, or certain private organizations by the use of threats and 
violence, established a minimum wage, a certain number of work-
ers would not be able to sell their labor, or all of the workers would 
not be able to sell as much as they would like; which, in any case, 
does not prejudge the question of the advantage or disadvantage that 
they could have in working more at a lower price, or less at a higher 
price. It is necessary at this point to refer to the theory of monop-
oly. Indeed, the theory of monopoly and that of price ixing are here 
related to each other: in the case of price ixing, we have just seen that 
the price of commodities is set arbitrarily and the volume of sales is 
determined in consequence; in the case of monopoly, as we shall see 
presently, the volume of sales is set arbitrarily and the price of com-
modities is determined in consequence. In either case, the goal can 
be set to obtain the greatest possible magnitude of the quantity sold 


Price ixing and monopoly 441

multiplied by the price; and that could be the Internationale’s guiding 
principle, one that the adversaries of that organization have no more 
refuted than its partisans have successfully defended.
361. he price of the product (B) being ixed at the maximum pb′ < pb, 
or at the minimum pb′′ > pb, the equality
bt pt + bp pp + bk pk = pb
would be replaced, in the irst case, by the inequality
bt pt + bp pp + bk pk > pb′
without there being the withdrawal of entrepreneurs that would nor-
mally result from the excess of the average cost over the price, which 
would lead to a rise in the price of (B); and in the second case, by the 
inequality
bt pt + bp pp + bk pk < pb′′
without there being the entry of entrepreneurs that would normally 
result from the excess of the price over the average cost, which would 
lead to a fall in the price of (B). In the case of a maximum, the entre-
preneurs, rather than incur the loss Db′(pb − pb′), represented by the 
area p′bB′b′pb (Fig. 35), would completely cease production. In the 
case of a minimum, those entrepreneurs who would be able to sell 
their products would realize a proit Db′′(pb′′− pb ), represented by the 
area pbb″B″p′b′ . hus, if a maximum were established for the price of 
bread, no bread would be baked; and if a minimum were established, 
bakers would sell at a proit. Under these conditions, there would 
hardly be any reason for establishing the maximum or the minimum. 
Matters are diferent if it is assumed that the State becomes an entre-
preneur to make, in the case of a minimum, a proit in lieu of a tax, 
and to make, in the case of a maximum, a loss that it covers by some 
tax or other. hese schemes can be more or less satisfactory, but we 
should not avoid criticizing them by declaring them impossible. It is 
easy to conceive of a country in which the State might manufacture, 
for example, the primary necessities of life at a loss and luxuries at 
a proit; and it remains to be demonstrated, by applied economics 


442 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

and social economics, that this system would not be consistent with 
either public welfare or social justice.
362. he economic theory of monopoly has been furnished in math-
ematical form, which is the clearest and most precise form, by 
Cournot in Chapter V of his Recherches sur les principes mathéma-
tiques de la théorie des richesses, published in 1838, and by Dupuit 
in two memoirs, the irst of which is titled, ‘De la mesure de l’utilité 
des travaux publics’, and the second, ‘De l’inluence des péages sur 
l’utilité des voies de communication’, published in 1844 and 1849 in 
the Annales des Ponts et Chaussées. Unfortunately, economists have 
not thought it pertinent to learn about that theory, and have been 
reduced, on the subject of monopoly, to a confusion of ideas that, 
in their work, is perfectly expressed by a confusion of terminology. 
hey have given the name of monopoly to economic activities that 
are found to be, not in the hands of one irm, but in the hands of a 
limited number of them. hey have even given, by analogy, the name 
of monopoly to the ownership of certain productive services that are

limited in quantity; for example, to the ownership of land. But all 
productive services are limited in quantity; and if landowners have 
a monopoly of land, workers have a monopoly of personal faculties, 
and capitalists have a monopoly of capital goods. With that sort of 
an extension of the sense of the terms, monopoly, being everywhere, 
is nowhere. In fact, the word monopoly has been shited from its 
original meaning and is used to express the idea of the limitation in 
quantity from which value and wealth result; and now there is no 
longer a word to express the circumstance of there being a product-
ive service or a product that is in the hands of a single irm. Now, it is 
precisely that circumstance that is of great importance here, because 
it nulliies these two conditions of free production: that the price of 
each product be equal to its average cost, and that that price is the 
only one for the product on the market. To make clear this double 
result of monopoly, it is best to present an example.
363. Let us assume there is an entrepreneur who, for one reason or 
another, has a monopoly of some product in the sense that we have 
agreed to understand that word. hat entrepreneur has the power to 
set the price of his product as he wishes. But what does not depend 
on him, for example, is the quantity of the product that is demanded, 
sold, consumed at whatever price is charged. In this respect, only one 
thing is certain: the dearer the product is, the less will be demanded, 
and the cheaper it is, the more will be demanded. It is absolutely cer-
tain for any given product that the demand for any product decreases 
as its price rises and increases as its price falls. he only thing that 
varies from one product to another is the law of the increase or 
decrease in demand as the price rises or falls; that is what Cournot 
and Dupuit call the law of demand, of sales, or of the consumption of 
each product. For every product there is, on the one hand, a max-
imum limit to price: it is the price at which the demand is zero, and, 
on the other hand, a maximum limit to the demand: it is the demand 
corresponding to a zero price, in other words, the quantity of the 
product that would be sold and consumed if the product were free 
and available in such a quantity that everyone can have as much as 
he wants. Let us assume that the demand for our product is zero at a 
price of 100 francs per unit, and that the demand corresponding to 
a price of zero would be 50,000 units. Let us assume, furthermore, 


444 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

that at diferent prices ranging from 100 to 0 francs and taking the 
values 50, 20, 5, 3, 2, 1 and 0.50 francs, the corresponding quantity 
demanded ranges from 0 to 50,000 units, amounting respectively to 
10, 50, 1,000, 2,500, 5,000, 12,000 and 20,000 units, in accordance 
with the above table.
he respective gross receipts will be, for our entrepreneur, 0, 500, 
1,000, 5,000, 7,500, 10,000, 12,000, 10,000, and 0 francs. hus the 
gross receipts start at zero when the price is at the maximum cor-
responding to a zero demand; they increase, reach a maximum, then 
diminish; and they return to zero at the zero price to which the max-
imum demand corresponds. he maximum gross receipts are real-
ized, in our example, at the price of 1 franc to which corresponds a 
demand of 12,000 units. hey are then 12,000 francs. If our entrepre-
neur had no costs of production, he would choose the price of 1 franc 
for his product: that is the one that would give him the greatest proit. 
How would he ind this price? By the simplest kind of tatonnement. 
Adopting at irst the highest prices, he would see that the demand is 
zero or very small, and that his receipts are also zero or very small. 
hen, lowering his price more and more, he would see the demand 
increase and his receipts along with it. In this way, he would arrive at 
the price of 1 franc. Continuing to lower his price, he would see that 
the demand continues to increase, but the receipts begin to dimin-
ish. He would immediately raise his price to 1 franc and keep it there. 
hat operation is performed without diiculty, and businesses do it 
all the time.

364. Generally, however, our entrepreneur will have some costs of 
production. He will have general expensesi and special expenses 
or, to put it more precisely, expenses that are more or less ixed and 
expenses that are more or less proportional to the quantity sold; that 
is to say, growing either exactly in proportion to that quantity, or in 
a greater or smaller proportion, all that depending, naturally, on the 
special and particular conditions of the industry. Let us assume, for 
greater simplicity, that the expenses relating to the manufacture of 
this product are proportional, amounting to 2 francs per unit. hese 
expenses will be, at the various assumed prices when the related 
quantities demanded are taken into account, respectively 0, 20, 100, 
2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 24,000, 40,000, and 100,000 francs. he corre-
sponding net receipts, equal to the excess of gross receipts over costs 
of production, will be 0, 480, 900, 3,000, 2,500, 0, –12,000, –30,000, 
and –100,000 francs. hus, maximum net receipts are earned, in 
our example, at a price of 5 francs per unit to which corresponds a 
demand of 1,000 units. It is then 3,000 francs. he price of 5 francs 
would therefore be the one that the entrepreneur should set. He 
would ind it by the same tatonnement as above.
365. For greater simplicity, we assumed that our entrepreneur had 
no ixed general expenses. If they were 1,000 francs, for example, it 
would be necessary to deduct these 1,000 francs from the net receipts 
obtained at each price, which would reduce the maximum net receipts 
by that amount, but would not change the position of this maximum, 
the price that maximizes proits being always the same. It is essential to 
note that the price that maximizes proits is completely independent  
of the ixed expenses.
366. Having found the price of 5 francs that gives him maximum 
proits, our entrepreneur would maintain it for the reason that he is 
the only seller of the product. If the product were not monopolized, 
the proits of the irm would attract competitors, the quantities sold 
and consumed would increase to 5,000 units, and the price would fall 
to 2 francs, equal to the 2 francs of expenses of production. Hence the 
consequence of monopoly is that, instead of having 5,000 units at a 
price of 2 francs, consumers have 1,000 units at a price of 5 francs. We 
see the diference. he principle of laisser faire, laisser passer applied 


446 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

to an industry subjected to unlimited competition has the result that 
the consumers obtain the greatest possible satisfaction of their needs 
consistent with the condition that each product has only one price 
on the market, this price being equal to the average cost, and the 
producers making neither proit nor loss; the same rule applied to a 
monopolized industry has the result that the consumers obtain max-
imum satisfaction subject to the condition that the price is higher 
than the average cost and that the producers make the greatest pos-
sible proit. We shall see shortly what happens to the uniformity of 
prices. In the irst case, the entrepreneur is an intermediary from 
whom we may make abstraction, and the landowners, workers, and 
capitalists exchange productive services for productive services with 
one another on the basis of equivalent values; in the second case, the 
entrepreneurs intervene, not only to combine the productive services 
and convert them into products, but to take for themselves a certain 
portion of the wealth exchanged.
367. We could extend the theory of the price that yields maximum 
proits in the case of monopoly to services as well as products. We 
could also give it a more abstract and scientiic expression than we 
have done so far, sharing with Cournot the equation of quantity sold 
as a function of the price: D = F( p).
Since, he says, the function F(p) is continuous, the function pF(p), that 
expresses the total value of the quantity annually sold must be continuous 
also. his function would become zero if p were zero, since the consump-
tion of a commodity is always inite, even on the hypothesis that it is abso-
lutely free; or, in other words, it is always possible to assign to the symbol p 
a value small enough that the product pF(p) becomes approximately zero. 
he function pF(p) disappears also when p becomes ininite; or, in other 
words, a value can always be assigned to p great enough that the commodity 
ceases to be demanded and produced at that price. hus, since the function 
pF(p) at irst increases with p and then inally decreases with it, there is a 
value of p that maximizes it and that is given by the equation
F(p) + pF′(p) = 0, [1]
F′ designating, according to Lagrange’s notation, the diferential coeicient 
of the function F.


Price ixing and monopoly 447

If we trace the curve anb (Fig. 36) of which the abscissas oq and the ordi-
nates qn represent the variables p and D, the root of equation [1] will be the 
abscissa of the point n from which the triangle ont, formed by the tangent 
nt and the vector ray on, is isosceles, so that we have oq = qt .1
In fact, the maximum of a function is given by the root of the 
equation of the derivative. he derivative of a product like pF(p) is 
equal to the sum of two products: the factor F(p) multiplied by the 
derivative of p, plus the factor p multiplied by the derivative of F(p). 
he derivative of p is equal to unity.
he equation of a tangent to the curve D = F( p) at a point with 
co-ordinates (D, p) is
y − D = F′(x)(x − p).

from equation [1], and then seek the point of interception of the tan-
gent with the x axis by setting y = 0, we get x = 2p.
It is on this determination of the maximum that Cournot founds 
his theory of monopoly. He passes from the case of a natural product 
to that of a manufactured product, and from maximum gross receipts 
to maximum net receipts; then from the case of a monopolist to that 
of two monopolists, and, inally, from monopoly to unlimited com-
petition. I have preferred, for my part, to start with unlimited compe-
tition, which is the general case, and to arrive at monopoly, which is 
a special case; and, proceeding in this way, I have been able (§§ 152, 
226) to relate the equations of exchange and of production, which 
are rational and rigorous, to the equation of sales as a function of the 
price, which is only an empirical and approximate equation.
368. We have just seen how monopoly undermines the condition 
that the price of a product equals its average cost; it remains for us 
to see how monopoly undermines the other condition, namely that 
there be only one price in the market.
Let us return to the example that we have used and assume, for 
more simplicity, that each consumer consumes only one unit of the 
commodity. At 50 francs a unit, 10 units would be sold; therefore, 
out of the 50 units that would be sold at 20 francs a unit, there would 
be at most 40 units for which that price is a maximum price and 
that, in all cases, would be sold at this price. In deducting in this way 
from the total quantity demanded at any given price, the total quan-
tity demanded at the price immediately greater, we obtain the partial 
quantity for which the irst price is a maximum and that, under all 
circumstances, would be sold at this price. Now, it can be assumed 
for a moment that in place of a single price there are several on the 
market, and that the partial quantity demanded is sold at each of 
them. In our example, on condition that all the indicated prices are 
maintained, and of forcing each consumer to pay the price that, for 
him, is a maximum, it will be possible to sell 0 units at 100 francs per 
unit; 10 units at 50 francs; 40 at 20 francs; 950 at 5 francs; 1,500 at 
3 francs; 2,500 at 2 francs; 7,000 at 1 franc; 8,000 at 0·50 francs; and 
30,000 at 0 francs, according to the following table.
hese operations would respectively yield the gross receipts 0, 500, 
800, 4,750, 4,500,5,000, 7,000, 4,000, and 0 francs. If only 50 and 20 


Price ixing and monopoly 449

francs, the irst two prices at which the quantity demanded is not 
zero, were charged, the total gross receipts would be 1,300 francs. 
And if there were not only these two prices, but the third, fourth, 
ith, sixth, and seventh prices at which the demand is not zero, the 
total gross receipts at each of these prices would be respectively 6,050, 
10,550, 15,550, 22,550, and 26,550 francs. In addition, 30,000 units 
could be given away.
369. he expenses of production being 2 francs per unit, the partial 
expenses of each of the partial quantities demanded at the diferent 
prices would be respectively 0, 20, 80, 1,900, 3,000, 5,000, 14,000, 
16,000, and 60,000 francs. Subtracting these partial expenses from 
the partial gross receipts, we obtain the net receipts: 0, 480, 720, 
2,850, 1,500, 0, –7,000, –12,000, and –60,000 francs. he sixth of 
these igures is zero; the last three are negative and represent losses. 
Eliminating prices like 0, 0.50, and 1 franc, that are lower than the 
average cost, and retaining only the others, we arrive at the follow-
ing result. If there were only two prices, 50 and 20 francs, the total 
net receipts would amount to 1,200 francs. And if there were not 
only these two prices, but also the prices 5 francs and 3 francs, there 
would be successively the total net receipts 4,050 francs and 5,550 
francs. hus, on the assumption that the expenses of production are 
2 francs per unit, the maximum net receipts would be 5,500 francs. 
In addition, 2,500 units could be sold at their average cost.

450 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

370. he preceding observation does not pertain exclusively to the 
case of monopoly. It is clear that if an entrepreneur, even one with 
a product sold under conditions of free competition, can adopt the 
average cost as an extreme limiting price and maintain, above that 
limit, staggered prices, and that if he can in addition lead each con-
sumer to pay the price among these that constitutes his maximum 
price, the monopolist would beneit from those very diferences. In 
fact, these assumed conditions really obtain much more frequently in 
trade and commerce than is thought. here is, among manufactur-
ers and merchants, an art of selling the same commodity at diferent 
prices, and at the highest possible price to each class of consumers; 
and the practice of that art is very oten facilitated by the thoughtless-
ness, vanity, and caprice of consumers. Sometimes it suices to use a 
variety of labels in order to multiply prices and to ind customers at 
each price. More oten, the commodity, while remaining fundamen-
tally the same, is given a slightly diferent form. hus, a manufacturer 
of chocolates, who sells his chocolate for 3 francs per pound when it 
is sold under the modest name ‘superine chocolate’, wrapped sim-
ply in glazed paper, will sell it for 4 francs a pound when he lavors 
with vanilla, and sells it with the name ‘the chocolate of princes’, and 
wrapped in gilt paper. he same is true of diferent seats in a theater, 
where the diferent prices are in no wise proportional to the costs 
of production of the seats. It is readily seen, however, that, under a 
regime of free competition, these techniques are much more diicult 
to employ, for the precise reason that, the spread of prices being con-
siderably greater than the expenses necessitated by the modiication 
of form and the change of labels, competition tends always to reduce 
that spread. Alongside our chocolate producer, there will soon be 
another who will sell ‘the chocolate of princes’ at 3 francs 80 centimes, 
thereby compelling our original manufacturer to ofer it at 3 francs 
60 centimes; whereupon, since the competitor will change his price 
to 3 francs 40 centimes, the other producer will be forced to charge 3 
francs 20 centimes. Under the regime of monopoly, on the contrary, 
nothing could be easier than to employ the schemes which are seen 
every day. Very oten a publisher, exclusive owner of rights over a 
sensational book by a famous author, sells a irst edition in octavo 
at 7 francs 50 centimes, then two or three editions in smaller format 
at 3 francs, and inally a popular edition at 1 franc. he diference in 


Price ixing and monopoly 451

the price of the paper and the cost of printing is insigniicant. he 
only diference consists in the greater or lesser speed of availability of 
the volume. By being more or less eager readers, the buyers thereby 
classify themselves with respect to the maximum price they are will-
ing to pay; and the publisher proits by this classiication. hat is, in 
regard to monopoly, the importance of the method that consists of 
maintaining several prices in place of a single one on the market and 
of leading the consumer to pay the highest possible price.
371. As we have already pointed out, Cournot was the irst to pre-
sent a scientiic theory of the fact of the decrease of demand with 
the increase of the price of commodities, and of the consequences 
of this fact, in his formulation of the mathematical conditions of 
maximum gross receipts and net receipts in the case of a monopoly. 
In this respect, Dupuit only repeated under the name of the law of 
consumption the propositions and corollaries originally presented by 
Cournot under the name of the law of sales. Dupuit’s own contribu-
tion, for example, was his observations on multiple prices for one 
and the same commodity. He made a very complete and ingenious 
study of this fact in the two memoirs that we have mentioned. We 
therefore limit ourselves at present to referring the reader to these 
two memoirs, but not, however, without drawing attention to a most 
serious error on a major matter.
372. Dupuit says that
he diverse considerations that we have just elaborated on utility, can be 
portrayed geometrically in a very simple fashion.
If we assume that, on an unbounded line oP (Fig. 37), the lengths op , 
op’, op″  represent the price of an article, and the perpendicular lines 
pn, p′n′, p″n″, represent respectively the number of units of the article 
consumed corresponding to these prices, we will form in this way a curve 
Nnn′n″P that we will call a consumption curve. oN represents the quan-
tity consumed when the price is zero, and oP the price at which consump-
tion becomes zero.
Since pn represents the number of units of the article consumed at the 
price op, the area of the rectangle ornp expresses the expenses of produc-
tion of np units, and, according to J.-B. Say, their utility. We believe that we 


452 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

have demonstrated that the utility of each of these np units is at least op , 
but that, for almost all, it is greater. For example, by erecting a perpendicular 
from p′, we will have n′p′ units for which the utility is at least equal to op′ , 
because they are bought at that price. Consequently, of the np units, there 
are only np − n′p′ = nq for which the utility is really no greater than op 
(or rather a mean between op and op′); for the others it is at least op′ . 
We are thus led to conclude that, for nq units, their utility is represented by 
the horizontal slice rnn′r′, and that the utility of the remaining qp or n′p′ 
units is greater than the rectangle r′n′p′o; assuming the price to be further 
increased by p′p″ we could demonstrate that, for n′p′ − n″p″ = n′q′ units, 
the utility is an average of op′ and op″ , and is given by the area r′n′n″r″ , 
etc., etc., and we would succeed in demonstrating that the absolute utility 
of these np units for the consumer is the mixtilinear trapezoid ornP. If 
we want to ind the relative utility, it suices to subtract the expenses of 
production, i.e., the rectangle rnpo, leaving the triangle npP, which, we 
contend, remains for the consumers of the np units ater they have paid for

them. It can be seen that the area of this triangle beyond the line np has no 
relation to that of the rectangle to the let of it.
When it is a question of a natural product that entails no cost to acquire 
it, the utility is expressed by the big triangle NoP.
We see that as the price of a good increases, its utility diminishes, but 
less and less rapidly, and that, on the contrary, when the price decreases, 
the utility increases, but more and more rapidly, since it is represented by a 
triangle that contracts or lengthens.2
373. his geometric representation is, in efect, a very exact and clear 
expression of Dupuit’s theory of utility. Instead of measuring utility, 
as J.-B. Say did, by the pecuniary sacriice that the consumer actually 
makes when he considers the price, Dupuit measures utility by the 
sacriice that the consumer is willing to make. he maximum pecu-
niary sacriice that a consumer is willing to make in order to procure 
a unit of product being the measure of the utility of this unit of prod-
uct for the consumer, it follows that the sum of the maximum pecu-
niary sacriices that all consumers are willing to make to obtain the 
largest number of units of a product that can be sold is the measure 
of the utility of this product for the totality of consumers or for soci-
ety. hus, the measure of total utility is given geometrically by the 
area under the demand curve as a function of price, and arithmetic-
ally by the total gross receipts that we have just obtained by adding 
the partial gross receipts. Unfortunately, all these assertions are erro-
neous, and Dupuit’s theory is no better than J.-B. Say’s. Undoubtedly, 
the maximum pecuniary sacriice that a consumer is willing to make 
to obtain a bottle of wine, for example, depends, in part, on the util-
ity of the bottle of wine for the consumer; because, according as this 
utility increases or decreases, the maximum sacriice in question will 
increase or decrease. But what Dupuit did not perceive is that this 
same maximum sacriice depends also, in part, on the utility that 
bread, meat, clothes, and furniture have for the consumer; for, as the 
utility he derives from other commodities increases or decreases, 
the maximum sacriice that he will be willing to make for wine will 
decrease or increase. And inally, what Dupuit also failed to see is 
that the maximum pecuniary sacriice depends, in part, on the quan-
tity of the wealth measured in terms of numeraire that the consumer 
2 Annales des Ponts et Chaussées, 2nd series. 1844. 2nd semester, p. 373.


454 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

possesses; for, according as this quantity is larger or smaller, the sac-
riice that he will be ready to make for wine will be larger or smaller. 
In general, the maximum pecuniary sacriice that a consumer is will-
ing to make to obtain a unit of a product depends not only on the 
utility of the product, but also on the utility of all the other products 
that are in the market, and also, inally, on the consumer’s means. 
We have already developed suiciently the interrelations among the 
phenomena of utility, efective demand, efective supply, and current 
price, to make it unnecessary to return to the subject here. Let us just 
say that it is appropriate to put entirely aside all the considerations 
in Dupuit’s two memoirs relative to the variation of utility with the 
prices and with the quantities demanded at these prices. It is true that 
these considerations are the principal subject of his study; but it is 
also true that he bases his considerations only on a complete confu-
sion between the utility or want curve and the demand curve.

LESSON 38

Taxation

SUMMARy: ― Role of the State. he State must be supported by 
either property or taxation. Hypothesis of a tax of 1 billion. he 
tax can be levied only on income; it can be levied on all incomes. 
hree sorts of direct taxes and one sort of indirect tax. Abstraction 
is made here from questions of rights, of economic advantageous-
ness, and even of practical possibility.
A direct tax on wages falls on workers’ incomes. A direct tax on 
rents falls on the landowners’ capital; when all the land has changed 
hands, the tax is no longer paid by anyone; its elimination is then a 
free git to the landowners. Its efects are attenuated in a progressive 
society as time passes. It is better for the State to become a propor-
tional co-proprietor than to levy a lump sum tax on land.
A direct tax on certain types of interest is partially an indirect 
tax on consumption; a direct tax on all types of interest is partially 
levied on the income of capitalists. he case of a tax on the income 
from the State’s bonds. An indirect tax on consumption is part of 
the expenses of production of products. It is levied more or less 
on the owners of productive services. he case of a tax on certain 
selected products.
374. To complete the theory of monopoly, we should show, when 
competition is unlimited, how the owners of services or the entre-
preneurs who produce products are led to combine with each other 
to proit from a monopoly. We should also, if we want to complete 
the subject of the efects of diverse modes of organization of produc-
tion and of the circulation of wealth, analyze the efects of prohibitive 
and protective tarifs, and of paper money. But we will ind all these 


456 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

questions more interesting when we treat, in the applied economics 
course, the exceptions to the principle of laissez faire, laisser passer, 
or its special applications: the question of combinations when we 
deal with the great economic monopolies such as those in mining 
and railways; with the question of prohibitive and protective tarifs 
when we deal with the freedom of foreign trade; with the question 
of paper money when we deal with the right to issue banknotes. At 
the present moment, we take up the subject of the efects of diferent 
systems of distribution of wealth.
375. In describing in the way that we have the mechanism of exchange, 
production, and capital formation, we have not only assumed com-
plete freedom of competition in the markets for products, services, 
and capital goods; we have also abstracted from two things: irst, the 
method of appropriation of services, whatever it may be, and, second, 
the role of the State, the services it provides and its needs. It is cer-
tain, however, that an economic society cannot function without the 
intervention of an authority charged with the duty of maintaining 
order and security, of rendering justice, of guaranteeing the national 
defense, and of performing many other services besides. he State, 
however, is not an entrepreneur; it does not sell its services in the 
market, nor according to the principle of free competition, that is, of 
the equality of price and average cost, nor according to the principle 
of monopoly, that is, of the maximization of net receipts; it oten sells 
its services at a loss and sometimes gives them away. And we will see 
later that this is as it should be, for the reason that the services of the 
State are collectively and not individually consumed. here remain, 
then, two ways of providing for the needs of the State, that is, for 
public expenditures: the irst is for the State as well as individuals to 
participate in the distribution of social wealth by owning property; 
the second is for it to use for its purposes a levy on the incomes of 
individuals taken by taxation. Which of these two systems is prefer-
able? Can they not be fused into one? hat is what we will examine 
in our course on social economics. We will see then how to work out 
simultaneously the theory of property and the theory of taxation. At 
present, we will inquire only into the natural and necessary efects of 
diferent kinds of taxes. Even if we assumed taxation to be abolished, 
it would still be useful, if only to know what is done and why it is 


Taxation 457

done, to know the efects of taxation. And, furthermore, that is yet 
another of the questions that we have a right to study in the inter-
ests of science, independently of any reasons for making practical 
applications. All the economists who have contributed to economic 
theory, like Ricardo, James Mill, and Destutt de Tracy, have devoted 
important chapters to it.
376. Let us reconsider the hypothetical country to which our eco-
nomic table (§ 268) refers, where there are 80 billion worth of land 
yielding annually 2 billion in rent, 50 billion worth of personal facul-
ties yielding 5 billion in wages, and 60 billion worth of capital prop-
erly speaking yielding 3 billion in interest. And now let us assume 
that there is a question in this country of raising annually, for public 
expenditures or for expenditures in the common interest, a sum of 
1 billion annually. his igure could be discussed and considered to 
be too large or too small in view of the needs of the State; but such 
considerations are not in the domain of economic theory. he essen-
tial thing here is to come to clear conclusions by simple calculations; 
I therefore take the igure of 1 billion for convenience and for clarity 
of the analysis.
377. Now, in order to pose properly the question of taxation properly, 
several observations are indispensable.
he irst is that capital should never be used for consumption, nei-
ther public nor private. It may be that some individuals consume their 
capital; they are free to do so, and this regrettable fact is compensated 
for by the fortunate circumstance that other individuals save out of 
their incomes. But the State should not systematically destroy the 
source of national wealth. Land, personal faculties, and capital goods 
properly speaking form the resources available for production. Land 
services, labor services, and capital good services constitute the fund 
available for consumption, and it is only on that fund that taxes ought 
to be levied.
378. here are therefore three incomes in a society: the services of 
land, the labor of personal faculties, and the ‘proits’ of capital goods 
properly speaking, sometimes consumed directly in the form of con-
sumable services, sometimes combined with one another in the form 


458 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

of productive services to make products, namely income goods and 
new capital goods properly speaking. he total value of consumption 
services and products is 10 billion, two-tenths of which, or 2 billion, 
are derived from land services, ive-tenths or 5 billion from labor, 
and three-tenths or 3 billion from ‘proits’. We must not lose sight of 
the fact that, among consumable services, that is, among the items 
of income subject to taxation, we include in particular the income 
from the personal faculties of persons who do not work and who 
lead a life of leisure, as well as the income from the land of those 
landowners who do not rent their land, and the income from the 
movable capital goods of those capitalists who do not lend their cap-
ital goods to others. We levy taxes only on incomes, but we levy them 
on all incomes. hat is not the way of proceeding of governments 
and theorists in general, for they, making their classiications purely 
empirically, are determined to tax workers, but never think of taxing 
idlers as owners of personal faculties.
At the same time as we have, in our society, three productive elem-
ents, we also have three classes of consumers: landowners, workers, 
and capitalists, corresponding to the three factors of production. 
he landowners receive as rent 2 billion in the form of services or 
products in return for 2 billion worth of land services; the work-
ers receive as wages 5 billion in the form of services or products in 
return for 5 billion worth of labor; and the capitalists receive as inter-
est 3 billion in the form of services or products in return for 3 billion 
worth of ‘proits’. Figures 2, 5 and 3 are the proportional amounts of 
consumption and of production. As for the entrepreneurs, they have 
no function here: no one earns his livelihood from being an entre-
preneur, and it is immediately evident that the tax can only fall on 
them insofar as they are landowners, workers, or capitalists.
We may now observe that whatever process the State adopts to 
collect taxes, the various possible ways of proceeding can be classi-
ied under four headings. In fact, the State can only intervene before 
or ater the exchange of services for consumption goods and services, 
or for products. In the second case, the State deals directly either with 
the landowners to take a part of their rents, or with workers to take 
a part of their wages, or with the capitalists to take a part of their 
interest income. his makes in all three kinds of direct taxation. In 
the irst case, the State takes its part from the social income viewed 


Taxation 459

not as composed of 2 billion of rent, 5 billion of wages, and 3 billion 
of interest, but as composed of 10 billion of consumable services and 
products. We have consumption goods and services. It deals with the 
entrepreneurs who advance it the total tax amount, with the under-
standing that they will reimburse themselves by adding the amount 
of the tax to the prices of the products that they sell to landowners, 
workers, and capitalists. hus, the rents, wages, and interest are indir-
ectly reduced. hat is indirect taxation. Direct taxes are levied on ser-
vices, and indirect taxes are levied on products. We are speaking here 
only of property taxes and not of personal taxes, which have neither a 
basis for assessment nor a traceable incidence.
379. Finally, it should be noted that we are abstracting from the right 
that the State can have to impose one or another of these four taxes, 
as well as from its interest in doing so, and similarly from the ease or 
diiculties that it can encounter in that operation, just as we made 
abstraction from the ease or diiculties of establishing maximum or 
minimum tarifs. In fact, the direct tax on rents is easy to establish 
although not without much efort and great expense; the direct tax 
on wages, with the exception of the one that is levied on the sal-
aries of government employees, and the direct tax on income from 
capital, with the exception of the one that is levied on house rent-
als and on the interest paid on the public debt, are on the contrary 
totally impossible to impose with any accuracy, no matter how much 
efort or money is spent for that purpose. An indirect tax is easy to 
impose on certain products and hard to impose on others. But these 
are practical considerations that must be put aside. If we assume that 
the State is invested with the power to collect the three kinds of direct 
taxes and the indirect taxes, and that it resorts successively to these 
four methods, what will happen? hat is speciically the subject that 
concerns us.
380. In our hypothetical country, the total annual wage bill amounts 
to 5 billion. If we assume that it is desired to impose a proportional tax 
of 1 billion on the income from personal faculties only, the immedi-
ate efect of such a tax would be the allocation to the State of one-ith 
of the wages of each worker. Now, the price of labor is determined, as 
we have seen, by the supply and demand that exists regarding services 


460 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

that are either consumable or productive. he imposition of the tax 
does not change these conditions in any way. he State acts simply 
as consumer of 1 billion worth of goods and services in place of the 
taxed workers. It is impossible to say which services or goods will 
be more in demand and which will be less in demand than before. 
It is equally impossible to say if the supply of labor will increase or 
decrease and even, if the supply increases or decreases, whether the 
total wage bill will increase or decrease. Consequently, it is necessary 
to abstract from these possibilities, or to assume that they compen-
sate for one another and assume that the wage rate will be the same 
ater the imposition of the tax as before. hus, the workers will ind it 
impossible to shit the tax to others by raising the price of their work. 
Each of them will be deprived of one-ith of his income. Assume, for 
example, that a worker works 10 hours and earns 5 francs a day, it can 
be said of him either that the State takes from him 1 franc every day 
or that he works two hours every day for the beneit of the State. here 
is only one case in which the tax can have a diferent efect, and that 
is the case in which wages are just suicient for the subsistence of the 
workers. hen the imposition of a tax has the inevitable consequence 
of a diminution of the working population, and the conditions of the 
efective supply of labor on the market for productive services will 
change. he supply decreases, wages rise, and the amount of the tax 
enters, in reality, into the cost of production of the products. Hence, 
it will be paid, in this case, by the consumers of the products; in all 
other cases, it will be paid by the workers.
381. A direct tax on rent would be a land tax, which, unlike the land 
taxes that have always existed and that still exist today, would fall 
exclusively on the income from land and not on the income from 
the capital goods properly speaking that are combined with land in 
agricultural industry. he same reasoning that has been made con-
cerning the tax on wages would serve to establish the fact that the tax 
on rent would have the efect of allocating to the State a portion of 
the income of landowners, without their being able to ind a way to 
pass the tax on to the consumers of products by raising the price of 
their land services. his was correctly stated, if not rigorously proved, 
by Ricardo in Chapter X of his Principles of Political Economy and 
Taxation. Taking that as his starting-point, Destutt de Tracy argued 


Taxation 461
with no less reason, in Chapter XII of his Traité d’économie politique, 
that when land is taxed in perpetuity, it is equivalent in every respect 
to the coniscation of a part of the land corresponding to the rate of 
the tax. Here is what he says, in his own words, on that matter:
As for the tax on land income, it is evident that it is he who owns the land 
at the time the tax is established that really pays, without being able to shit it 
to anyone else; for it does not give him the means of increasing his products, 
since it does not add anything to either the demand for the commodity or 
to the fertility of the land, and does not cause any decrease in the expenses 
of production. Everyone agrees that this is true; but what has not been sui-
ciently noticed is that the landowner in question ought to be considered less 
as having been deprived of a portion of his annual income than as having lost 
the part of his capital that would produce that portion of income at the cur-
rent rate of interest. he proof of this is that if a farm that yields a net income 
of ive thousand francs is worth one hundred thousand francs, the day ater a 
perpetual tax of one-ith of its value has been levied, if it is put on sale, will be 
worth, all other things being equal, only eighty thousand francs, and will be 
valued at only eighty thousand francs in the assets of an estate in which there 
are other items that have not changed in value. When, indeed, a State declares 
that it takes in perpetuity a ith of the income of land, it is as if it had declared 
itself proprietor of a ith of the asset, for no property is worth more than the 
utility that can be derived from it. hat is so true that when, as a result of a 
new tax, the State obtains a loan for the interest of which it pledges the tax 
revenue, the operation is consummated. he State has really drawn upon the 
capital it has appropriated, and has used it up all at once instead of spending 
the income annually. his is like when Mr. Pitt made a once-for-all levy of the 
capital value of the land tax levied on the landowners. hey found themselves 
free of the tax, and Mr. Pitt used up the capital value.
herefore, it follows that, once all the land has changed hands ater the 
establishment of the tax, it is not really paid by anyone. he buyers, having 
acquired only what remains, have lost nothing; for heirs, having received 
only what is in the estate, the surplus is as if their predecessor had spent it 
or lost it, as in actuality he lost it; and in the case of inheritances abandoned 
as worthless, it is the creditors who lost the capital that the State took out of 
the property that served as security for the loan.
It follows, also, that when the State gives up all or part of a land tax for-
merly established in perpetuity, it simply and purely makes a git to the cur-
rent landowners of the capital value of the income that it no longer collects. 
From their point of view, it is an absolutely free git, to which they have no 
more right than any other citizen, because none of them had counted on 
that capital in the transaction by which he became a landowner.


462 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

he results would not be exactly the same if the tax had originally been 
established only for a given number of years. hen there would really have 
been taken from the landowner only that part of their capital that corres-
ponds to the given number of annual tax payments. he State, furthermore, 
would have been able to borrow only this sum from the lenders to whom 
it would have given the tax in payment for their principal and their inter-
est, and in transactions the land would have been considered as reduced in 
value by only that amount. In this case, when the last tax installments and 
the corresponding interest coupons on the loan are paid, the debt is extin-
guished on both sides, because it is paid of. on the whole, the principle is 
the same as in the cases of a perpetual tax and of a perpetual loan.
It is always true then, that when a tax is levied on the income from land, 
there is taken away from those that currently possess it a value equal to the 
capital value of the tax; and when all the land has changed hands ater the 
tax is levied, it is, in reality, no longer paid by anyone. his observation is, 
indeed, unusual but important.i
Destutt de Tracy erroneously extends his observation to a tax on 
the income from buildings, and erroneously up to a certain point, as 
we shall see, to a tax on government bonds; but in the respects that it 
deals with a tax on the income from land, his observation is perfectly 
well founded on reasoning and conirmed by history. It has always 
been known that taxes on land income, whether levied by the State, 
feudal lords, the Church, or any religious community, afect the value 
of the landed capital, and do so exactly by the ratio of the amount of 
the tax to the amount of the rent. It has happened that the tax has 
sometimes completely absorbed the rent, and then the value of the 
land to the owner has been reduced to zero. his leads us to another 
observation that has also not been made and that is no less important 
than the preceding one.
382. he value of land and of land services rises steadily in a pro-
gressive society; this fact results mathematically from our theory of 
social wealth. From this, it follows, irst of all, that the harm done to 
the irst generation of landowners, at the time of the establishment of 
the tax, diminished as time passes, while the later landowners, who 
have never lost anything, beneit fully from the increasing value of 
the landed capital and land income. It follows, also, that it is better 
for the State to establish the tax on the basis of a deinite proportion 
of the rent rather than as a lump sum, because, in the former scheme, 


Taxation 463

its proportional part will grow at the same time as that of the land-
owners. he establishment of that land tax will have thus had the 
deinitive result of associating the State with the ownership of the 
land or of sharing the ownership of the soil between individuals and 
the State. It is clearly seen now how the two questions of property 
and taxation are intimately related to each other.
383. If we now assume, in our hypothetical country, there is levied 
entirely on rents not a ixed tax of 1 billion, but rather a tax raising 
one half of the total of the rents, this is what will happen:
1o he landowners who own the land at the time of the establish-
ment of the tax will, irst of all, be deprived of half of their capital as 
well as half of their income. he State will become a co-proprietor, 
owning half of the land.
2o When all the land has changed hands by sale, git or inherit-
ance, the tax will no longer be paid by anyone.
3o As soon as economic progress has raised the total rent from 
2 to 4 billion, the original owners who held on to their land will 
recuperate their losses completely and the new owners will see their 
income double.
4o he revenue of the State will itself increase from 1 to 2 billion.
It is therefore certain that it is preferable for the State to become 
a co-proprietor of the land than to be entitled to a rent assessed on 
the land, if the society is a progressive society and on the condition 
of attentively overseeing the increases in the value of land and of 
land services. We will return to this question when we deal with the 
cadaster.
hose are the conclusions of a study of a tax on rents. he efects 
of that tax are the same at irst as those of a tax on wages; but they 
soon become intermingled with other phenomena that result from 
two facts: 1o that land can be bought and sold, which is not the case 
for personal faculties in countries that prohibit slavery, and 2o that 
the value of land and of land services rise constantly in a progressive 
society, which is a characteristic peculiar to this type of wealth.
384. Now let us assume that a tax is imposed directly on the inter-
est charges on capital properly speaking, and ask what will happen.  


464 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

I maintain in this case that if the tax is imposed on the interest charges 
on all kinds of capital goods without exception, all capitalists would 
be afected in proportion to their incomes, just as they would be by 
a fall in the rate of income. Moreover, a fall in the rate of income can 
lead either to an increase or to a decrease in savings (§ 238); therefore 
we cannot put aside this consequence and assume that the incidence 
stops there. But, that having been said, I will make an observation, 
applicable to a degree to taxes on land and personal faculties, but 
much more so to taxes on income from capital goods properly speak-
ing, because: 1o it is diicult, if not impossible, to reach all capital 
goods, and 2o capital goods are products, the price of which, under 
normal conditions, must equal the average cost: the observation, 
namely, that if the tax is imposed on the interest income from only 
certain kinds of capital, the tax on interest would be, in part, a tax on 
consumption. To demonstrate this, I will show how we pass from the 
second situation to the irst by extending the tax on a certain kind of 
capital good to all the kinds of capital goods successively.
Let us return to our hypothesis of a country in which there are  
60 billion worth artiicial capital, yielding annually 3 billion in inter-
est, and in which it has been decided to impose exclusively the 
income from artiicial capital by a proportional tax of 1 billion; but 
let us assume that we proceed by irst establishing a tax of one-third 
of house rents. Let us single out, from all the owners, the owner of 
a house worth 60,000 francs yielding annually 3,000 francs in house 
rent. From these 3,000 francs, the tax takes 1,000 francs per annum; 
if this measure has only the simplest and most direct efect, the house 
in question would thereater yield only 2,000 francs in income and 
would consequently not be worth more than 40,000 francs. But we 
know that the 60,000 francs correspond to the total cost of produc-
tion of the house. Now, if houses cost 60,000 francs to construct but, 
upon completion, are not worth more than 40,000 francs, entrepre-
neurs will lose 20,000 francs on each house. Under these conditions, 
the building of houses stops at once; old houses deteriorate and fall 
into ruins, new ones are not built; thus, little by little, and as the efect 
of the laws of the market, house rents rise, and the value of houses 
rise in keeping with them; rents and houses recover their value; pro-
duction is resumed and events resume their natural and normal 
course. he time will come, for our landowner, when his house will 


Taxation 465

be worth 60,000 francs and will yield 4,000 francs in annual interest, 
from which the State will take 1,000 francs in taxes. Who then will 
pay the tax? he tenants. he tenants will be of two sorts. Some will 
rent the house in order to live in it; in technical terms, they will buy 
the capital service for use as a consumable service. others will rent 
the house to install an industrial enterprise in it; they will buy the 
capital service for use as a productive service. In the irst case, the tax 
will be paid immediately; in the second case, the tax will be included 
in the expenses of production of the industry and will be paid, in the 
inal analysis, by the buyers of the products of that industry.
Hence a tax on house rent would act like a tax on consumption, 
at least in part; because, if we look at the matter closely, we will see 
that the burden falls partly on the capitalist. In fact, the capital goods 
previously employed in the construction of houses being transferred 
to all sorts of other employments, a general decline in the rate of 
income would result, to the detriment of all capitalists including 
the owners of houses, and to the advantage of all consumers includ-
ing the renters of houses. It would be possible to try to discover the 
extent to which the consumers would recover, through the decline in 
the prices of other services and products, what they lost by the rise 
in house rents.
Having taken note of these two phenomena, it is now easy to 
understand that if we pass from houses to railways and then, in turn, 
to capital goods of all kinds without exception, the original distri-
bution of savings among the various types of capital goods will be 
restored; in such a way that, inally, the number of houses, railways, 
and all other capital goods will become what it was before, there 
would remain only the general and growing fall of the rate of income 
and that consequently the tax would cease to weigh upon the con-
sumers and would weigh exclusively upon the capitalists.ii
385. he case of a direct tax levied in perpetuity on State bonds 
deserves special consideration. If, ater the tax has once been intro-
duced, the State does not borrow any more, the bonds will be like 
natural wealth, and the owners of the bonds will lose capital at the 
same time as they lose income. he quotation on the securities 
exchange of these bonds will fall the same day as the establishment 
of tax. If, on the contrary, the State borrows more, the bonds become 


466 Price ixing, monopoly, and taxation

like produced wealth, and the subscribers of the new bonds will take 
them only at a price corresponding to the current rate of interest. 
If they foresee that the State is going to impose a new tax, they will 
deduct another proportional amount from the subscription price; 
and, at the moment of the establishment of that tax, the fall in value 
having already been anticipated, the fall of the bond price will cease, 
or at least it will not be extreme.
386. Consideration of a tax on interest income leads us to a tax on 
products. Let us assume that, in our country, it has been decided to 
impose a proportional tax of 1 billion to be assessed on the 10 bil-
lion worth of products annually produced and no longer on any part 
of the 10 billion worth of services. he iscal authority will then call 
upon the entrepreneurs and will collect the tax in proportion to the 
value of the products. It is evident that, in the state of general equilib-
rium of exchange and production, the entrepreneurs, being assumed 
to make neither proit nor loss, must consider the amount of the tax 
as an addition to their expenses of production and add it to the price 
of their products. If this cannot be done immediately, it will be done 
ultimately, by ceasing production, decreasing the quantity and rais-
ing the price of the products, as in the case of houses. hus, sooner 
or later, the total amount of products will be sold to the consumers 
for 11 billion and the consumers will pay the tax. hat is why the tax 
on products is also called an indirect tax on consumption. We count 
consumable services here among the products, considering them as 
products made with a single productive service, with the owner of 
the service being the entrepreneur.
387. But we have identiied thus far only a part of the complete inci-
dence of the consumption tax. It cannot be supposed that the price 
of all the services or products will rise proportionally by 10 per cent. 
here are, among these services or products, goods of prime necessity 
for which the efective demand will fall very little in consequence of 
such a rise in price; and there are luxury articles, for which the efect-
ive demand will fall considerably as the price increases. Hence the irst 
efect of the tax, levied, as we have assumed, on all products in propor-
tion to their value, would be, above all, to diminish the consumption 
and consequently the production of certain luxury articles. From this 
it results that the price of productive services that are used together in 


Taxation 467

the production of those articles would fall in the market for those ser-
vices. herefore the consumption tax results also in a decrease in the 
value of certain productive services. We may note that the efects of a 
consumption tax being therefore to restrict the demand for services 
or products, the yield of 1 billion would not be obtained by a tax of 10 
per cent, and that it would be necessary to impose a higher tax rate.
388. In general, a consumption tax is not imposed on all products 
any more than a direct tax is imposed on all categories of interest 
income. Certain products that are widely and dependably consumed 
are selected to bear the tax. It is thus that, in our hypothetical country, 
it is possible to raise 1 billion in taxes on salt, beverages, and tobacco. 
In this case, the efects of the tax are those we have just described, 
but restricted naturally to the products on which it is imposed; that 
is to say that it is paid partly by the consumers of these products, 
and partly by the owners of the productive services that enter into 
their production, these latter being more or less afected according 
to whether the product is more or less an article of prime necessity 
or a luxury, and also according to whether the productive service is 
more or less specialized. A tax on wheat would weigh more heavily 
on consumers of bread and not much on landowners because bread 
is an article of prime necessity; a tax on wine, on the contrary, would 
weigh much more heavily on landowners, irst, because wine is, to a 
certain degree, a luxury, and, second, either because the land suited 
for vineyards cannot be used for any other kind of agriculture, or 
because there would not be any advantage in changing the purpose 
or the use of the land as a consequence of the tax. It can be seen how 
complex the incidence of consumptions taxes is and how much the 
efects of a tax on one or another product require separate study. his 
is what needs to be done when it is a question of taking practical 
decisions; but the general principles that we have considered amply 
suice us for the development of the theories of social economics 
and applied economics that we have in mind.

APPENDIX I

Geometrical theory of the determination  
of prices

I THE EXCHANGE oF SEVERAL CoMMoDITIES FoR oNE 
ANoTHER

1. In my Éléments d’économie politique pure, passing from the theory 
of the exchange of two commodities to the theory of the exchange of 
several commodities for one another, and seeing that in that case the 
demand for or the supply of each of the commodities by each of the 
traders is a function not only of the price of that commodity but also 
of the prices of all the others, I believed that it was necessary to adopt 
exclusively the analytic method of expression and to do without the 
help of diagrams. But since then I have found a means, that I will 
describe briely, of working out the theory in question by the method 
of geometrical representation.
Assume that an exchanger holds, for a certain period of time, the 
quantities qa ,qb ,qc ,qd , of the commodities (A), (B), (C), (D), 
represented by the lengths oqa ,oqb ,oqc ,oqd , (Fig. 38), and has, 
during the same period of time, the wants for those commodities 
expressed by the curves αq αr , βqβr, γ q γ r, δq δr , . I must explain 
the nature and indicate the law of these curves that are the essential 
and fundamental basis of the entire mathematical theory of social 
wealth.1

1 of the three sections composing that theory, the irst appears in a memoir read 
to the Société des ingénieurs civils de Paris on october 17, 1890, and reproduced 
in the January 1891 Bulletin of that Society, to which section I have made some 
modiications, one of which is quite important, with the aim of simplifying the

last two of which sections similarly appear, together with some modiications 
introduced by the irst section, as part of a text written for the Recueil inaugural 
of the University of Lausanne (1892). he héorie géometrique de la détermina-
tion des prix appeared in English, very nearly as it is presented in this irst appen-
dix, in the July 1892 number of the Annals of the American Academy of Political 
and Social Science.


Geometrical theory of the determination of prices 471

It is permissible to say in ordinary language: ‘he desire that we 
have for things, or the utility that the things have for us, decreases 
as their consumption increases. he more we eat, the less hungry we 
are; the more we drink, the less thirsty we are, at least in general and 
except for certain unfortunate exceptions; the more hats and shoes 
we have, the less need we have of a new hat or a new pair of shoes; the 
more horses we have in our stables, the less efort we make to procure 
one more horse, always excluding impulsive behavior, from which 
the theory has the right to abstract except when taking account of 
one or another special case.’ But, in mathematical terms, we will say: 
‘he intensity of the last want satisied, is a decreasing function of 
the quantity of commodity consumed’; and we will represent these 
functions by curves, the quantities consumed by the ordinates, and 
the intensities of the last want satisied by the abscissas. For example, 
take the commodity (A), the intensity of the want for our consumer, 
that would be oαr at the beginning of the consumption, would be 
zero ater the consumption of a quantity oαq , the consumer having 
then reached satiety. I call that intensity of the last want satisied, to 
be more brief, its rareté. he English call it the Final degree of utility, 
the Germans Grenznutzen. It is not a measurable quantity; but it is 
suicient to conceive of it in order to found the demonstration of the 
great laws of economic theory upon the fact of its diminution.
2. For the present, let pb , pc , pd , be the prices of (B), (C), (D),  in 
terms of (A) cried at random in the market. he irst problem that 
we have to solve consists of determining the quantities x, y, z, w,  
of (A), (B), (C), (D), , some of the quantities positive, namely the 
quantities demanded, some of them negative, namely the quantities 
supplied, that our trader will add to the quantities qa ,qb ,qc ,qd , that 
he possesses, or that he will subtract from them, so as to consume 
the quantities qa + x, qb + y, qc + z, qd + w, represented by the 
lengths oa, ob, oc, od,[Fig. 39]. Just as we employed above the 
general hypothesis of an exchanger for whom the rareté decreases 
with the quantity consumed, so we employ here the general hypoth-
esis of an exchanger who seeks in the exchange the greatest satisfac-
tion of his wants. Now, the sum of the wants satisied by a quantity  
oa of commodity (A), for example, is the surface oaρaαr. he efective 


472 Appendixes

utility is the deinite integral of the rareté in relation to the quantity 
consumed. Consequently, the problem whose solution we are seek-
ing consists precisely of determining oa,ob,oc,od,, subject to the 
condition that the sum of the shaded areas oaρaαr, obρbβr, ocρc γ r , 
odρdr,  be a maximum.

Fig. 39


Geometrical theory of the determination of prices 473

In order to furnish that solution very simply in geometric form, I 
subject the curves of utility or want βqβr, γ q γ r, q r ,  to the following 
transformation. I measure of from the origin o upon the horizontal 
axes the new abscissas equal to 1

p times the old abscissas. And, on the 
parallels to the vertical axes drawn through the extremities of the new 
abscissas, I measure of from the horizontal axes the new ordinates  
equal to p times the old ordinates. In the igure, pb = 2, pc = 3, 
pd = 0.5, . As is easily understood, the new curves βq′βr′, γ q′γ r′,δq′δr′, 
represent the utility of (A) to be spent for (B), for (C), for (D), or, 
in other words, the want the exchanger has for (A) in order to pro-
cure some of (B), of (C), of (D) Indeed, if we consider the areas 
oβqβr, oγ q γ r , oδq δr ,  as the limits of sums of ininitely small rec-
tangles, we may consider the surfaces oβq′βr′, oγ q′γ r′, oδq′δr′,  as the 
limits of equal sums of ininitely small rectangles, each base being p 
times less, and each height p times greater. Now, each of the rectan-
gles of the former sum represents the efective utility of an increment 
of commodity; each of the rectangles of the latter sum represents, in 
the same way, the equal efective utility of the p increments of (A) 
with which that increment of commodity is bought.
he curves αq αr , βq′βr′, γ q′γ r′,δq′δr′, being placed in vertical order, 
I take a vertical length oQa , representing the equivalent in terms of 
(A) of the quantities qa ,qb ,qc ,qd , of (A), (B), (C), (D),  at the prices 
1, pb , pc , pd ,, namely qa + qb pb + qc pc + qd pd +, and I draw it from 
right to let in such a way as to satisfy the varying wants in the order of 
their intensity, until it is sub-divided among the curves into the ordi-
nates raρa = oa, raB = ob′ , raC = oc′ , raD = od′,  corresponding 
to the same, particular abscissa ora.i hat abscissa ora will represent 
the rareté of (A) in terms of (A), of (B), of (C), of (D), , namely ra,  
corresponding to a maximum of efective utility. he ordinates 
oa,ob′,oc′,od′,  will represent, in terms of (A), the quantities to 
be consumed of (A), of (B), of (C), of (D), , the only commodities 
to be consumed being those for which the intensity of the irst want 
to be satisied is greater than ra. If we carry back the abscissas ora = ra ,

γ q γ r, δq δr, , we would obtain the ordinates oa, ob, oc, od, 
representing the quantities of (A), of (B), of (C), of (D),  to be con-
sumed.2 he exchanger will therefore ofer, when all is said and done, 
the quantities x, z,  of (A), (C), , represented by q a a , qc c, , and 
will demand the quantities y, w,  of (B), (D)… represented by qbb, 
qdd, . And thus, in a state of maximum satisfaction, the raretés are 
proportional to the prices, in accordance with the equations:

3. hat is how, given the quantities possessed and the utilities of the 
commodities, we determine for an exchanger the demand for or 
supply of each of the commodities, at prices cried at random, that 
will provide the maximum satisfaction of his wants. here remains, 
given the demand and supply of commodities by all the parties in the 
exchange at prices cried at random, to determine the current prices 
at equilibrium, subject to the condition of the equality of the total 
efective demand and supply. he solution of the second problem is 
also amenable to being furnished geometrically.

2 We would also be able, as I did in the memoir read to the Société des ingénieurs 
civils, to construct a total curve by superimposing all the transformed partial 
utility curves of (B), (C), (D),  on the partial utility curve of (A) by the add-
ition of all the ordinates corresponding to the same abscissa. It is also easy to take 
into account the circumstance that the total curve represents the total utility of 
(A) used, in terms of (A), of (B), of (C), of (D), or, in other words, the total 
want that the exchanger would have for (A) in order to obtain some of (A), of 
(B), of (C), of (D), . Indeed, if we consider the surfaces of the partial curves 
as limits of sums of ininitely small rectangles, we could consider the surface of 
the total curve as the limit of the total sum of all these rectangles superposed 
one upon another in the order of their horizontal length. By putting the ordin-
ate oQa into the total curve, we would obtain the abscissa ora representing the 
rareté of (A) in terms of (A), of (B), of (C), of (D), , corresponding to the 
maximum efective utility, namely ra. hat diagram, which can be constructed 
not only in the case of the exchange of several commodities for each other but 
also in the case of the exchange of products and services for each other, permits 
bringing to light, in a rigorous fashion, the gains of utility made in exchange and 
production.


Geometrical theory of the determination of prices 475
Let us, for an instant, make abstraction from pc , pd , and seek 
irst to determine pb provisionally. And, for that purpose, let us ask 
how, pc , pd , being assumed constant, the variations of pb inluence 
the demand and supply of (B).
If y is positive; that is to say, if the trader is a demander of (B), an 
increase of pb can only decrease y. In short, if that exchanger demands 
the same quantity at a higher price, he would owe a diference that he 
would not be able to pay except by decreasing his quantities of (A), 
(C), (D), . But he will then increase his raretés of these commod-
ities; and, in consequence, the condition of maximum satisfaction 
will be approached even less. Hence, the quantity demanded y is too 
great for a price higher than pb. And, in consequence, the demand 
curve is decreasing.
If y is negative; that is to say, if the exchanger is a supplier of (B), 
there are three possible outcomes. he exchanger, being assumed to 
supply an equal quantity at a higher price, is due a surplus, and by 
means of that diference he can increase his quantities, and conse-
quently decrease his raretés of (A), (C), (D), . hen, one of three 
things occurs: either the surplus is insuicient to reestablish the 
condition of maximum satisfaction, or it is exactly suicient, or it 
is more than suicient; and, in consequence, at a price higher than 
pb, the exchanger must supply a quantity of (B), either greater than, 
equal to, or less than y. It is certain that he will ind himself in one of 
these three situations, depending upon the degree of increase of pb.
Let us assume that an exchanger who, at the prices pb , pc , pd , of 
(B), (C), (D),  in terms of (A), is a supplier of a quantity ob of (B) 
and a demander or supplier of (A), (C), (D),  in such a way as to 
obtain maximum satisfaction in conformity with the equations:

If, in this state of afairs, pc , pd , remaining constant, pb increases, 
and if our exchanger supplies always the quantity ob of (B), using, 
as he should, the diference that is due him for the purchase of (A),

[i e r

assume: 1o that the prices pc , pd , are not ininite, 2o that the num-
ber of commodities in the market is not ininite, 3o that the exchanger 
cannot consume an ininite quantity of any of them, the latter ratios 
will become zero at some price of (B) that is quite high, although 
not ininite, so that the diference that is due permits the exchanger 
to have all that he wants of (A), (C), (D), . And, at this point, the 
respective ratios of the raretés at those prices being 0

the exchanger, to regain his maximum satisfaction, will have to sell 
quantities of (A), of (C), of (D) to purchase (B); that is to say, to 
decrease his supply ob of (B).
It is therefore very certain that the rise of pb that causes the exchan-
ger to switch from being a demander to being a supplier, makes 
him switch, additionally, from an increasing quantity supplied to a 
decreasing one; that is to say, in other words, that the supply curve, 
taken positively, is successively increasing and decreasing. Moreover, 
we can assume the supply ob to be ininitely small at a certain price 
of (B); but it is necessary that this price be ininitely great in order 
that ra ,rc ,rd , become zero. hen satisfaction will be maximized by 
virtue of the equations:

that is to say that the supply becomes zero again at an ininitely great 
price, and that, in other words, the supply curve is asymptotic to the 
price axis.
he variation of pb, from zero to ininity, therefore causes the 
exchanger to switch from the side of demand to the side of supply; 


Geometrical theory of the determination of prices 477

then from an increasing supply to a decreasing supply. When the price 
is zero, the demand is equal to the excess of the quantity necessary 
to satiate completely the desire for the commodity over the quantity 
possessed; at an ininitely high price, the amount supplied is zero. In 
the case of the exchange of several commodities, just as in the case 
of the exchange of two commodities for each other, these preferences 
can be represented geometrically for an exchanger by a curve bdbpbo 
(Fig. 40) referred to the two axes: irst, qbp, the price axis, and, second, 
bdo, the axis of quantities demanded above the origin qb, and the axis 
of quantities supplied below that origin. hus, at the price of zero, our 
exchanger would demand a quantity of (B) represented by qdbd , at 
the price pb, represented by qbpb , he demands a quantity represented 
by pb y = qbb; at the price bp, represented by qbbp , he would neither 
demand nor supply; at higher prices, he would supply the quantities 
represented by the distances from the qbp axis to the curve bpbo ; at an

ininite price, he would no longer be a supplier, the curve bpbo being 
asymptotic to the qbp axis.
All the exchangers having preferences that are not the same but are 
similar as far as concerns the commodity (B), it is clear that all the 
partial demand curves can be added up to a total curve BdBp that con-
tinually decreases (Fig. 41), and all the partial supply curves added 
up to a total curve NP′, successively increasing and decreasing, from 
zero to zero, if we take it positively and asymptotic to the price axis, 
and make NP′ turn around the horizontal axis so as to bring it into 
the position NP.iii he abscissa op′b of the point of intersection B of 
the two curves BdBp and NP will provisionally be the current equi-
librium price at which the total efective supply and demand for (B) 
will be equal. Furthermore, that intersection of the two curves, BdBp 
and NP, can take place either when the second curve rises, or when 
it falls.

Geometrical theory of the determination of prices 479

It follows from the nature of the curves that we will obtain the 
provisional current price of (B) by raising it in case of an excess of 
efective demand over efective supply, and lowering it, on the con-
trary, in case of an excess of efective supply over efective demand. 
Passing then to the determination of the current price of (C), then 
to the current price of (D) and so forth, we obtain them by the same 
means. It is certainly true that, in determining the price of (C), we 
may destroy the equilibrium with respect to (B); that, in determining 
the price of (D), we may destroy the equilibrium with respect to (B) 
and with respect to (C), and so on. But, inasmuch as the determin-
ation of the price of (C), of (D), of  will have, on the relation of the 
demand and supply of (B), efects in opposite directions, the market 
will probably always be closer to equilibrium ater the second round 
of tatonnement than ater the irst.iv We enter here into the theory 
of tatonnement as I have expounded it in my works and in virtue of 
which the equilibrium of the market is reached by raising the price of 
commodities whose demand is superior to the supply and lowering the 
price of those whose supply is superior to the demand.
4. hanks to the concurrent employment of analytic expression and 
geometric representation, we have here not only the idea but also 
the image of the phenomenon of the determination of prices in the 
market in the case of the exchange of several commodities for one 
another; and with this, in my opinion, we possess at last the theory. 
Some critics, however, have made fun of the number of pages I used to 
demonstrate that the current price will be reached by raising the price 
in the case of an excess of the demand over the supply, and lowering 
it in case of an excess of the supply over the demand. — ‘And you,’ I 
said once to one of them, ‘how do you demonstrate it?’ — ‘But,’ he 
answered, a little surprised and even quite embarrassed, ‘does it need 
to be demonstrated? It seems to me to be evident’. — ‘here is noth-
ing evident except axioms, and this is not one. But you are implying, 
I assume, the reasoning that Jevons formulated explicitly in his little 
treatise Political Economy, namely that raising the price, and thereby 
necessarily making demand decrease and increasing supply, leads to 
their equality in case of there being an excess of one over the other’ 
— ‘Precisely’. — ‘Very well! here is an error here: the rise necessarily 
decreases the demand; but it does not necessarily increase the supply. 


480 Appendixes

If you are a supplier of wine, it may very well be that you supply less 
at a million, than at a thousand francs, less at a billion than at a mil-
lion, simply because you would prefer to drink your wine yourself, 
rather than use the superluous commodities that you would be able 
to acquire by selling it for more than a certain price. he same is true 
of labor: we comprehend perfectly that a man who supplies ten hours 
per day of his time at a price of 1 franc an hour would not supply more 
than four at the price of 10 francs per hour, and only one at a price of 
100 francs. We see, every day, in the large towns, that workers, when 
they earn 20 or 25 francs a day, do not work more than three or four 
days a week.’ — ‘But if that is so, how is raising the price a means of 
reaching the current price?’ ‘hat is what the theory explains to you. 
Two individuals can meet either by walking toward each other or, if 
they are walking in the same direction, by one overtaking the other. 
Supply and demand equalize themselves, sometimes in the irst man-
ner, sometimes in the second.’
Is it not worthwhile to demonstrate rigorously the fundamental 
laws of a science? We count today I do not know how many schools of 
economics: the deductive school and the historical school; the school 
of laisser faire and the school of State interventionism or academicians’ 
socialism, the socialist school properly speaking, the Catholic school, 
the Protestant school. For me, I recognize only two: the school of 
those who do not demonstrate their propositions, and the school, 
that I hope to see founded, of those who will demonstrate their prop-
ositions. It is through demonstrating rigorously the elementary theo-
rems of geometry and algebra, then the theorems of the calculus and 
mechanics that are deduced from them, in order to apply them to 
experiential data, that we achieve the marvels of modern industry. 
Let us proceed in the same way in economics, and we shall, with-
out doubt, succeed in acting upon reality in the economic and social 
order as we have done in the physical and industrial order.

II THE EXCHANGE oF PRoDUCTS AND SERVICES FoR 
oNE ANoTHER

5. he concern at present is to extend the method of exclusively geo-
metric demonstration that I used in sketching the theory of exchange 


Geometrical theory of the determination of prices 481

in the preceding section to the theory of production and the theory 
of capital formation. Now, in formulating the theory of exchange, it 
is assumed that the quantities of the commodities are given and not 
unknowns of the problem; to construct irst of all the theory of pro-
duction, the commodities must be considered as products resulting 
from combining productive services with each other, and, in con-
sequence, the quantities made of products must be introduced into 
the problem as that number of unknowns, and adding to them, as is 
appropriate, an equal number of determining mathematical condi-
tions. hat is what I am going to do here, referring to my Éléments 
d’économie politique pure for deinitions and notations.
6. Assume, then, that there are the landed, labor, and movable-capital 
services of the kinds (T), (P), (K),  susceptible of being utilized, 
either directly as consumable services or indirectly as productive ser-
vices; that is to say, in the form of the products of the kinds (A), (B), 
(C), (D), . he irst problem that we have to solve consists of deter-
mining, for each consumer, the supply of services and the demand for 
services, either in the form of consumable services or as products. But 
the solution of the problem is furnished us by the theory of exchange. 
Assume there is a consumer possessing, during a certain period, the 
quantities qt ,qp ,qk , of the services (T), (P), (K), , and having, 
during the same period of time, wants for these services and wants for 
the products, (A), (B), (C), (D),  expressed by the curves of utility 
or want giving the raretés, or the intensities of the last wants satisied, 
by their abscissas as decreasing functions of the quantities con-
sumed represented by their ordinates. And assume that pt , pp , pk ,, 
πb ,πc ,πd , are the prices of (T), (P), (K),  and of (B), (C), (D),  
in terms of (A) cried at random in the market. We will transform the 
curves of utility or of want for services and products other than (A) 
into curves of utility of (A) used in (T), in (P), in (K), , in (B), in 
(C), in (D), , or, in other words, into curves of wants for (A) to be 
used in procuring some (T), some (P), some (K), , some (B), some 
(C), some (D) , by dividing the abscissas and multiplying the ordi-
nates by the prices that are cried. he curve of the utility or want of 
(A) and the transformed curves of utility or want of (T), (P), (K),   
(B), (C), (D),  being placed one under the other, we will draw a 


482 Appendixes

vertical line Qa = qt pt + qp pp + qk pk +[+qb pb + qc pc + qd pd +]v 
in length from right to let until it is divided up among all the curves 
into ordinates corresponding to the same abscissa. hat abscissa will 
represent the rareté or the intensity of the last want satisied of (A) 
in the form of (T), of (P), of (K),  of (A), of (B), of (C), of (D), , 
namely ra, corresponding to a maximum of efective utility. By car-
rying back the abscissas pt ra , ppra , pk ra , , ra , pbra , pc ra , pd ra , 
 to the primitive curves, we obtain the ordinates representing the 
quantities of services (T), (P), (K),  and of products (A), (B), (C), 
(D),  to be consumed. It is evident that in the state of maximum 
satisfaction, the raretés will be proportional to the prices in accordance 
with the equations:

Geometrical theory of the determination of prices 483
been produced, and, leaving pt , pp , pk , as they are, we are going 
to determine the prices of (B), (C), (D),  by the condition that the 
demand for the products is equal to their supply; that is to say, to the 
quantity produced. he solution of the second problem is also fur-
nished to us by the theory of exchange. Assume, then, that ∆b, repre-
sented by the ordinate πb ∆b (Fig. 42), is the total demand for (B) at 
the prices cried for services and products. We know, by the theory of 
exchange, abstracting at irst from the prices of (C), (D),  and seek-
ing to determine provisionally the price of (B), that if we vary this 
price from zero to ininity, the demand for (B) will decrease always 
in accordance with the curve BdBp. Hence, there exists a price πb′ cor-
responding to the equality of the demand for (B) with the supply Ωb,  
that is > πb if, at the price πb, the demand for (B) is greater than the 
supply, and that is < πb, if, at the price πb, the supply of (B) is greater 
than the demand. We will likewise ind a price πc′ corresponding to 
the equality of the demand for (C) with the supply Ωc, a price πd′ cor-
responding to the equality of the demand for (D) with the supply Ωd,  
and so on. Ater that irst tatonnement, we will proceed to a second, 
to a third reprise, and so on, until we have obtained a series of prices 
πb′′, πc′′, πd′′,  at which the demands for (B), (C), (D),  would be 
equal to the supplies Ωb, Ωc, Ωd, . We state, therefore, that in the 
matter of production, as in the matter of exchange, the equilibrium 
in the market for products is reached by raising the price of those com-
modities for which the demand is greater than the supply and lowering 
the price of those commodities for which the supply is greater than the 
demand.
8. πb′′, πc′′, πd′′,  are therefore the prices of the quantities Ωb, Ωc , Ωd, 
 of (B), (C), (D). But, the prices pt , pp , pk , of the services, (T), 
(P), (K)  result in certain average costs pb , pc , pd , of the products, 
(B), (C), (D), .3 And the diferences, positive or negative, between 
the prices and the average costs in the production of (B), (C), (D),   
3 It is true that, in order to assume there is an average cost common to all the 
entrepreneurs, it is necessary to assume that the ixed expenses are distributed 
over the same quantities of products, in order to be able to put them into the 
same category as proportional expenses; that is to say, it is necessary to assume 


484 Appendixes
result in the gains or losses Ωb (πb′′− pb ), Ωc (πc′′− pc ), Ωd (πd′′ − pd ), . 
It is now necessary to determine the quantities produced of (B), 
(C), (D),  subject to the condition that the price and average cost 
be equal, so that there will be neither proit nor loss for the entre-
preneurs. his third problem is the particular problem of the the-
ory of production, and may also be solved geometrically as follows. 
Let opb (Fig. 43) be an abscissa representing the average cost pb. 
And let oπb′′ be an abscissa representing the price πb′′, and πb′′B′ an 
ordinate representing the quantity Ωb of (B) produced at random 
and demanded at the price πb′′. If we assume pt , pp , pk ,, πc′′, πd′′, 
determined and constant, and that we vary the price of (B) from zero 
to ininity, it is certain that the demand for (B) will always decrease 
following a curve Bd′B′p. Consequently, there exists a demand Ωb′, 
corresponding to a price equal to the average cost. Ωb′ will be  Ωb 
according to whether πb′′ pb. We can also ind a demand Ωc′ cor-
responding to a price equal to an average cost pc , a demand Ωd′ cor-
responding to a price equal to an average cost pd and so on. If we 
now were to substitute the produced quantities Ωb′, Ωc′, Ωd′ , for the 
produced quantities Ωb, Ωb, Ωb,  and sell them in accordance with 
the mechanism of rise and fall of prices described in the preceding 

that all the entrepreneurs are producing the same quantities of products. he 
hypothesis is no more real than that of the absence of proit and of loss, but it 
is as rational. If, in efect, at a given point a certain quantity of products corres-
ponds to the absence of proit and of loss, the entrepreneurs that produce less 
than that amount make losses, reduce their production and end by going into 
liquidation, and those who produce more make proits, increase their produc-
tion, and attract the customers of the failing irms. hus, owing to the distinct 
nature of proportional expenses and ixed expenses, production under free com-
petition, ater taking place with a great number of small enterprises, tends to be 
distributed among a smaller number of medium-sized enterprises, then among 
a small number of large enterprises, inally ending up, irst in a monopoly selling 
at average cost, then in a monopoly selling at the price that gives maximum proit. 
his statement is corroborated by the facts. But it is, during the entire period of 
competition and even during the period of monopoly selling at average cost, 
always permissible, in order to simplify the theory, to assume that the entrepre-
neurs produce the same quantities of products and to treat the ixed expenses as 
proportional expenses.

sections, we would obtain new prices that would still be slightly dif-
ferent from pb , pc , pd ,. Proceeding ater that to a second, to a third 
reprise of the two tatonnements… and so on, we would inally obtain 
certain quantities Db,Dc ,Dd , of (B), (C), (D) being sold at prices 
equal to the average costs pb , pc , pd ,. We can then enunciate this 
proposition that belongs speciically to the theory of production: the 
equality of the price of products and their average cost in productive 
services is attained by increasing the quantity of products for which 
the price exceeds the average cost, and by decreasing the quantity of 
those whose average cost exceeds their price. By this it is seen that, 
strictly speaking, the consideration of the expenses of production 
determines not the price but the quantity of the products.4

9. our prices of services pt , pp , pk , are always determined at ran-
dom; there remains for us a fourth and last problem to solve, which 
is to determine the way in which the quantities demanded and 
the quantities supplied are equalized. Now, at the point at which 
we have arrived, there are quantities supplied of (T), (P), (K), , 
Ut ,U p ,Uk , that are determined by the condition of maximum sat-
isfaction, in conformity with the solution of our irst problem. And, 
opposite these quantities supplied, there are quantities demanded 
that are composed of two elements: irst, the quantities demanded 
by the consumers in the way of consumable services ut ,up ,uk , that 
are also determined by the condition of maximum satisfaction; then 
the quantities demanded by the entrepreneurs in the way of product-
ive services, Dt ,Dp ,Dk , that are determined by the quantities pro-
duced of the products (A), (B), (C), (D), , for which the demand 
is equal to the supply, and the price equal to the average cost, in con-
formity with the solution of our second and third problems. It could 
be demonstrated exactly as in the theory of exchange that if, every-
thing else remaining equal, p is made to vary from zero to ininity: 
1° the demand for (T), Dt + ut, will always decrease following a curve 
TdTp (Fig. 44); 2° the supply of (T) will, starting from zero, increase, 
then decrease and return to zero following a curve QR; and that, con-
sequently, there exists a price pt′, at which the supply and demand of 
(T) are equal, which is > pt if, at the price pt, the demand for (T) is 
greater than the supply, and < pt if, at the price pt, the supply of (T) 
is greater than the demand. here exists, likewise, a price p′p at which 
the supply and demand of (P) are equal, a price pk′ at which the sup-
ply and demand of (K) are equal, and so on. Ater a irst series of 
tatonnements with the prices pt , pp , pk ,. including, of course, the 

determinate and completely independent of the costs of production. his is the 
problem of exchange and shows how the prices depend only on the rareté, that is 
to say, on the utility and the quantity possessed of the commodities. But if, ater-
wards, these individuals, having found on the island the necessary productive 
services, proceeded to produce the same commodities and carried them to the 
market, the commodities whose price exceeds their average cost would become 
more numerous, and those whose average cost exceeds their price would become 
fewer, until the equality of price and average cost was established. hat is the 
problem of production and it shows how the consideration of the cost of produc-
tion determines the quantity and not the price of the products.

tatonnements in the second and third problems, we would proceed 
to a second reprise on the prices pt′, p′p , pk′,, then to a third, and 
so on. And, consequently, an equilibrium of the market for services 
is reached, as in the one for products, by raising the price of those for 
which the demand is greater than the supply, and lowering the price of 
those whose supply is greater than the demand.5
10. We must envision as taking place simultaneously all the opera-
tions that, by the requirements of the demonstration, we have had 
to assume occur successively; that is to say, in the market for prod-
ucts and in the market for services, the demanders raise the price 
when the demand exceeds the supply, and the suppliers lower the 
price when there is an excess of supply over the demand; the entre-
preneurs who make products increase their production when the 
price exceeds the average cost and, on the contrary, reduce it when 
the average cost exceeds the price; and, here again, thanks to the

geometric representation, we will have an exact and complete pic-
ture of the general phenomenon of the establishment of economic 
equilibrium under the rule of free competition. But, nevertheless, 
the analytic form of expression would be necessary to achieve a truly 
scientiic idea of the matter. To achieve it, then, ater having deined 
the elements of the system, or, the quantities that come into play, 
it would be necessary to distinguish the givens and the unknowns, 
to express by equations the conditions of economic equilibrium, to 
establish that these equations are exactly equal in number to that of 
the unknowns, to show that, through the tatonnements, the solu-
tion is more and more closely approached, to explain the particular 
conditions of equilibrium so far as concerns the numeraire product 
(A), all matters of which nothing has been said here and regard-
ing which I will take the liberty of referring the reader to part III 
[above] of my Éléments. he present exposition is therefore only 
a summary but one which, perhaps, nonetheless enables a better 
perception of the general course of the theory. As is clearly seen 
here, the theory of production, like that of exchange, begins with 
the problem of each exchanger obtaining maximum satisfaction 
of wants and ends with the problem of the establishment on the 
market of the equality of supply and demand. Except that services 
are substituted for goods. And, indeed, in the mechanism of pro-
duction, we exchange services for services. But while a part of the 
services that we buy is indeed services, another part is services in 
the form of products. It is necessary therefore to introduce into the 
theory the fact of the transformation of a part of the services into 
products; and that is what I did in the second and third problems. 
I did it in the simplest possible fashion, and almost all of the criti-
cisms that have been leveled at me have consisted in pointing out 
to me various complications from which I had abstracted. My reply 
is very easily conceived. he objective that I set for myself, as far 
as I am concerned, was to expound and explain the mechanism 
of production by reducing it to its essential elements. Economists 
that come ater me are free to bring into it, one by one, whatever 
complications they want. hey and I, I think, will thus have done 
all that we should do.

III THE EXCHANGE oF SAVINGS FoR NEW 
CAPITAL GooDS

11. In order to simplify, we will assume for the moment that the 
equilibrium prevails that was established regarding the quantities of 
commodities produced as well as the prices of commodities and of 
services, and we will abstract from the changes in this equilibrium 
that can result from the search for the special equilibrium of capital 
formation. We will similarly make abstraction from the depreciation 
and insurance of capital goods.
12. he elements of the equilibrium of capital formation are the quan-
tities produced of new capital goods and the rate of income, i, from 
which result the prices of the capital goods in accordance with the 
general formula Π = p
i . Let us therefore assume that there are pro-
duced at random the quantities Dk ,Dk′ ,Dk′′ , of new capital goods 
of the types (K), (K′), (K″), and that there is a rate of income i cried 
at random. At that rate, each exchanger determines the excess of his 
income over his consumption, and the total of these individual excess 
quantities forms a total excess quantity E, which is the quantity of 
numeraire ofered to buy new capital goods, or, the demand for new 
capital goods at the rate i. on the other hand, at the current prices, 
assumed to be determined and constant, of their productive services 
pk , pk′ , pk′′ ,, the quantities Dk ,Dk′ ,Dk′′ , of the capital goods (K), 
(K′), (K″) yield a total income Dk pk + Dk′ pk′ + Dk′′ pk′′ +, and 
have a total value
D p D p D p

i

k k + k′ k′ + k′′ k′′ ,,
which is the quantity of numeraire demanded in exchange for the 
new capital goods or the supply of new capital goods at the rate i. If, 
by chance, these two quantities of numeraire were equal, the rate i 
would be the equilibrium rate of income; but generally they will be 


490 Appendixes

unequal and it is a question of leading them to equality. Now, it can 
be assumed in fact that the excess of the income over consumption 
is at irst zero at a zero rate, then it begins to grow at a positive and 
increasing rate, then decreases and returns to zero if the rate tends 
to become ininitely great; that is to say, if, with a minimum saving, 
it is possible to obtain an extremely large increment of income. In 
other words, the rate of income shown as an abscissa on the axis oI 
(Fig. 45), the excess of income over consumption will be the ordinate 
of a curve ST successively increasing and decreasing. As for the value 
of the new capital goods, it evidently increases or decreases accord-
ing as the rate of income decreases or increases. In other words, the 
rate of income being an abscissa on the axis oI, the value of the new 
capital goods will be an ordinate of a curve UV that is always decreas-
ing. Hence, it is immediately seen that it is necessary to raise the price 
of the new capital goods by lowering the rate of income if the demand 
for new capital goods in numeraire is greater than the supply, and to 
lower the price of the new capital goods by raising the rate of income 
if the supply of the new capital goods in numeraire is greater than the 
demand.

13. At this point, at the prices Πk ,Πk′ ,Πk′′ , of the new capital goods 
(K), (K′), (K″),  there are the average costs Pk ,Pk′ ,Pk′′ ,. And it 
is a question of leading them to reduce the prices and the average 
costs to equality, which generally does not exist between them. Now, 
we may regard as justiied by the foregoing demonstrations that by 
increasing or decreasing the quantity of a capital good (K), the rareté 
and the price of its use are decreased or increased, and, consequently, 
so is the price of the capital good; that is to say, the curve of the quan-
tity as a function of the price is a constantly decreasing curve KdKp 
(Fig. 46). And we are equally justiied in stating that by increasing or 
decreasing the quantity of the same capital good (K), the rareté and 
the prices of the productive services that enter into the making of the 
capital good are increased or decreased, and, consequently, so is its 
average cost; that is to say that the curve of quantity as a function of 
the average cost is an increasing curve Xy. Hence, it is seen immedi-
ately and without the necessity of reproducing here the exposition of 
the successive tatonnements on the quantities of capital goods (K), 
(K′), (K″) and of the successive reprises of tatonnement, that it is 
necessary to increase the quantity of the new capital goods whose price 
exceeds their average cost and to decrease the quantity of those whose 
average cost exceeds the price.

that is to say, the rate of income is the same for all the savings that 
are capitalized. It can be demonstrated geometrically in a very simple 
manner, at least as far as concerns capital goods that produce con-
sumable services, that this identity of rate of income is the condition of 
the maximum utility of new capital goods.
here are two problems of maximum utility relative to the services 
of new capital goods: the one that arises in regard to the distribution 
by an individual of his income among his various kinds of wants, 
and the one that arises in regard to the distribution by a society of 
the excess of its income over its consumption among the various var-
ieties of capital goods. he irst is solved, by virtue of the construction 
that was made in the theory of exchange and that we recalled at the 
beginning of the theory of production, by the proportionality of the 
raretés to the price of its services, in accordance with the equations:

iv If there were no irrevocable disequilibrium transactions, there would be 
only one tatonnement. Virtual pricing and determination of virtual supply 
and demand quantities would go on until a set of general equilibrium prices 
is found. hen actual trade would occur, ater which all markets would sim-
ultaneously reach equilibrium. However, there are disequilibrium transac-
tions in Walras’s system in the following sense. In each temporarily isolated 
market during the course of reaching temporary equilibrium, there are no 
trades at which market supply and demand are unequal, no market day 
disequilibrium transactions. he price in each market is changed until 
desired supply and demand are equal, whereupon trade occurs. However, 
the prices are not equilibrium ones from a general equilibrium point of 
view; the trades at prices temporarily equating supply and demand are dis-
equilibrium trades. he traders learn the prices that have been temporarily 
settled upon in other markets, and they readjust their supply and demand 
quantities, thus disrupting the temporary equilibria. he new set of individ-
ual desired supply and demand functions are not the same as the ones that 
existed at the initial distribution of assets, so they are not equal at the set of 
prices that have been found at the end of the initial tatonnement. A reprise 
of tatonnement begins. Prices are raised or lowered again in accordance 
with the Walrasian rule until a new temporary equilibrium price is found.

and thus to general equilibrium.

APPENDIX II

observations on the principle of Messrs. 
Auspitz’s and Lieben’s theory of prices1
1. According to Messrs. Auspitz and Lieben, the price of a commodity 
is determined by the slope of the vector ray oc that is common to the 
two curves oN′ and oA′ (Fig. 47). hese two curves are respectively 
the curves of the derivatives (abgeleiteten Kurven) of i oN and oA; 
that is to say, the vector rays of the former are parallel to the tangents 
of the latter. Hence, whatever the meaning of the curves oN, oN′, 
oA, oA′, it is evident that the irst two can be replaced by a single 
curve νν′ (Fig. 48) giving by its areas the values that the curve oN 
gives by its ordinates, and giving by its ordinates the values that the 
curve oN′ gives by the slope coeicients of its vector rays; and the 
latter two by a single curve αα′ giving similarly by its areas the values 
that the curve oA gives by its ordinates, and by its ordinates giving 
the values that the curve oA′ gives by the slope coeicients of its 
vector rays. hus, divested of their disguises, the two curves vv′ and 
αα′ immediately appear to us as Cournot’s2 and Mangoldt’s3 curves 
of demand and supply that have been used by a number of English

Observations on Auspitz’s and Lieben’s theory of prices 497

of intersection p gives the demand equal to the supply, and that the 
ordinate Οπ of the same point gives the price equal to the average 
cost.
2. he irst observation to be made on the subject of these curves 
is that, since their ordinates represent prices in money, the use of a 
numeraire is assumed implicitly in specifying them, the introduction 
of which without a prior analysis is not good scientiic method.
3. he demand curve νν′, or, the curve representing the quantity sold 
as a function of the price, cannot be accepted as being a rigorously 
exact curve. he quantity sold of a product is a function not only 
of its own price, but also of the prices of all other products and the 
prices of all productive services. Messrs. Auspitz and Lieben assume 
that the prices of other products and the prices of productive services 
do not vary while the price of the product under consideration var-
ies. heoretically, they have no right to do this. he prices of prod-
ucts and the prices of productive services depend on each other. In 
varying the price of a product, the prices of the productive services 
are changed, and consequently the prices of the other commodities 
also. It is strange that those authors have wrongly taken me to task, 
in their preface, for an error that I have good reason here to accuse 
them of committing, namely that of treating demands that are func-
tions of several variables as functions of a single variable.
4. he deinite integral of the demand function does not represent the 
total utility; and, consequently, if the curve oN′ (Fig. 47) is a demand 
curve (Nachfragekurve), then the curve oN is not a total utility curve 
(Gesammtnützlichkeitskurve). Here Messrs. Auspitz and Lieben fall 
into Dupuit’s error, to which I called attention in lesson 37 of my 
Éléments d’économie politique pure. It follows that the consumers’ 
surplus (Nutzen der Konsumtion) is not measured by the expression 
that they give.
5. he supply curve αα′ or average cost curve as a function of the quan-
tity of output, is not acceptable either. he average cost of a prod-
uct is a function of the prices of the productive services employed 
in the production of the product; and it is because the prices of 


498 Appendixes

the productive services increase or decrease that the average cost 
increases or decreases with the quantity produced. But, as the prices 
of the productive services increase or decrease, the average costs of 
all the products in the production of which those services are used 
will also increase or decrease; and the economic equilibrium will 
be completely disturbed. It is, therefore, theoretically impossible to 
construct an average cost curve for a product as a function of the 
quantity produced of the product on the supposition that economic 
equilibrium will maintain itself with respect to the average costs and 
with respect to the quantities produced of other products.
6. he deinite integral of the supply function does not represent the 
total cost of production of the quantity manufactured. In the sys-
tem of free competition, every unit in the quantity Οa (Fig. 48) must 
be considered as having the same average cost ap, whence it follows 
that the total cost is represented not by the area oαpa, but by the 
area oπpa. Consequently, if the curve oA′ (Fig. 47) is a supply curve 
(Angebotskurve), the curve oA is not a total cost of production curve 
(Gesammtherstellungskostenkurve). herefore, there is no such thing 
as a producers’ surplus (Nutzen der Produktion) that would be meas-
ured by the given expression.ii
7. It remains to examine the construction on the supposition that it 
is being proposed as an approximate construction. Now, by referring 
back to the equations of production (Éléments, §§ 198, 199), we will 
become convinced that the construction is needlessly contradictory 
and complex.
In order to construct the demand curve for (B), we must take from 
system [2] the equation
Db = Fb ( pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,)
It is assumed that pt , pp , pk ,, pc , pd , are determined and con-
stant. All possible values are given to pb and all the corresponding 
values of Db are obtained from the equation. In order to construct 
the supply curve, it would be necessary to take all the equations of 
systems [1] and [3], and eliminate Ot ,Op ,Ok ,, to obtain


Observations on Auspitz’s and Lieben’s theory of prices 499
at Da + bt Db + ct Dc + dt Db += Ft ( pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),
apDa + bpDb + cpDc + dpDb += Fp (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),
ak Da + bk Db + ck Dc + dk Db += Ft (pt , pp , pk ,, pb , pc , pd ,),


and to take from system [4] the equation
bt pt + bp pp + bk pk += pb
and substitute it into the above equations. It would then be assumed 
that Da ,Dc ,Dd , ,pc , pd , are determined and constant. All possible 
values would be assigned to Db, from the modiied equations we take 
pt ,pp ,pk , and thus we obtain all the corresponding values of pb.4
he intersection of the two curves of demand and supply would give 
the value of Db at which the price is equal to the cost of production.
Now, on the one hand, it is evident that, in the second oper-
ation, pt , pp , pk , are varied, and so consequently are pc , pd ,, 
which are assumed to be determined and constant in the irst oper-
ation. And, on the other hand, as soon as pt , pp , pk , are assumed to 
be determined and constant, it suices to deduce pb from them and 
to substitute this value of pb into the equation of the demand curve 
to obtain Db .
Let pb = Οπ = ap. If the quantity oa1 < oa is produced, the price 
will be a1p1 > oπ; there will be a proit and output will increase. If the 
quantity oa2 > oa is produced, the price will be a2p1 < oπ; there will 
be a loss and output will decrease.
Moreover, this curve of demand as a function of the average cost is 
also a curve of the price as a function of the quantity supplied.
Let oa be that quantity. If the price a1p1 > ap is cried, the demand 
will be oa1 < oa, and it will be necessary to lower the price. If the 
4 he abscissas of the curve would be successively increasing and decreasing as its 
ordinates progressively increased, and would be asymptotic, not to a line parallel 
to the price axis as Messrs. Auspitz and Lieben believe, but to that axis itself.


500 Appendixes

price a2p2 < ap is cried, the demand will be oa2 < ap, and it will be 
necessary to raise the price.
Conceived of in this way, the demand curve has served me in the 
construction of the pure and applied theory of money.5 I would not 
wish to maintain that, in one or another question, it would not be 
advantageous also to use the supply curve. But I assert adamantly 
that those two curves cannot serve as the starting-point of a com-
plete and rigorous theory of the determination of prices.

Notes
i Walras should have inserted at this point the words ‘the functions whose 
graphs are, respectively’.
ii Walras could have criticized purely mathematical aspects of the nonsens-
ical igure. he derivative of oN is initially positive and then everywhere 
decreasing and so cannot be increasing and then decreasing. oN′ cannot be 
the derivative of oN. he derivative of oA is certainly not oA′. he deriva-
tive of the former would lie much closer to the vertical axis.

5 As soon as it is assumed that the market is in a complete state of equilibrium, 
except in regard to product (B), the curve vv′ represents the two curves BdBp 
(Fig. 42) and Bd′B′p (Fig. 43) of Appendix I conlated into a single curve of which 
the abscissas represent the quantities and the ordinates the prices. hat is my 
price curve.

Note on Mr. Wicksteed’s refutation of the 
English theory of rent1

1. he exposition and refutation of the English theory of rent that 
forms the subject of lesson 31 of my Éléments d’économie politique 
pure is one of the problems of mathematical economics that has 
given me the greatest trouble and that has thus far had the fewest 
readers. It was, however, an attempt to formulate a rigorous cri-
tique in mathematical language of one of the theories about which 
the confused and sterile discussion in ordinary language has engen-
dered such a volume of writings that just listing them would ill a 
book; and I have always been convinced that an attempt at a formu-
lation would attract the attention and excite the zeal of mathematical 
economists when they had had enough of the vacuity that currently 
constitutes the critique of economic theory. hat is why I read atten-
tively Mr. Wicksteed’s short treatise on this subject, and found with 
the liveliest satisfaction that his work reached, by the same methods, 
exactly the same conclusion as mine.

of the productive services employed in their production’, and having

ing the relation between the coeicients of production (§ 274) and 
having the form
φ(bt ,,bp ,,bk ,) = 0
Mr. Wicksteed writes the equation
P = F(A, B,C,)
subject to the condition
mP = F(mA,mB,mC,)
(Essay, Prefatory Note and § 6); and deduces from it
P dP

dA A

dP
dB B

dP
= + + dC C +
(Essay, § 6). He calls P ‘the product’, and A, B, C ‘the factors of pro-
duction’; and writes the former as a ‘function’ of the latter. hat way 
of expressing matters is ambiguous by design: the author reserves the 
right to interpret P ad libitum as either a quantity or a value. But this 
is a minor matter. If P = Db and is the quantity of output, his

and his equation does not difer from mine (if it really difers at all) 
except by being more general in form.i
3. Having posited this equation, Mr. Wicksteed makes a detailed 
criticism of the English theory of rent (Essay, § 5) that is identical to 
the one I made (Éléments, lesson 31).
I modify the English theory in such a way as to express it in a 
formula
pt = F(x) − xF′(x)
that I recognize as being the same statement as the equation
bt pt ++ bp pp ++ bk pk + = pb .
Mr. Wicksteed starts with his equation
P dP

dA A

dP
dB B

dP
= + + dC C +
and derives from it a formula expressing the modiied English 
theory
pt = F(c) − cF′(c).
For exacting readers, I will note that Mr. Wicksteed and I each 
make a slightly diferent modiication to the English theory.


504 Appendixes

In my formulation, the variable x is ‘the total, in numeraire, of the 
diferent kinds of personal and movable capital (P), (P′), (P″), , 
(K), (K′), (K″),  applied to the land (T)’, in accordance with the 
equation
x H b P b P H

= ( p p ++ k k +) = i (bp pp ++ bk pk +),

H

= bt

1 1

 

ϑ(bp ,,bk ) being the number of units of product obtained 
per unit of land (§ 306). From this it follows that my F (x )= Hpb, that 
my F′(x) = i, that my xF′(x) = H(bp pp ++ bk pk +), and, inally, 
that my pt = Hpb − H(bp pp ++ bk pk +). 
In Mr. Wicksteed’s formulation, the variable c would be, in a nota-
tion like mine, ‘the number of units of capital + labour (K) applied to 
land (T)’, in accordance with the equation
c = Hbk
(Essay, p. 24). From this it would follow that his F(c) = Hpb, 
that his F′(c) = pk, that his cF′(c) = Hbk pk, and, inally, that his 
p1 = Hpb − Hbk pk.
For Mr. Wicksteed as well as for myself, the total area under 
the curve, representing F(x) or F(c) is, therefore, ‘the total amount 
of units of output in numeraire’, and the upper area, representing 
F(x) − xF′(x) or F(c) − cF′(c), is ‘the amount of rent measured in 
numeraire’ and not in units of product as in the English theory. But 
the fact that, advancing matters further than Ricardo and Jevons 
along the same path, I take as my abscissa the total in terms of numer-
aire of the personal and movable capital applied to land, and as my 
ordinate the rate of net income in numeraire, permits me to assume 
any number of services; and the fact that Mr. Wicksteed takes as his 
abscissa the number of units of capital + labor applied to land, and as 
his ordinate the price of the service, compels him not only to reduce 
all the diferent varieties of personal capital to a single category and 
all the diferent varieties of movable capital to a single category, but 


Mr. Wicksteed’s refutation of the English theory of rent 505

to lump those two categories together into a single one. hat way of 
proceeding is explained by his intention: 1o to represent the law of 
the variation of rent geometrically, and 2o to invert the situation of 
the two factors land and capital + labor in order to construct for their 
situation a geometrical theory symmetrical to the geometrical theory 
of the aforementioned law. But whatever intrinsic merit this arrange-
ment may have, it nevertheless constitutes only a diference of form; 
and the substance of his criticism consists, as I have said, in deducing 
the formula of the English theory of rent from an equation similar to 
my average cost equation, just as I reduce the formula of the English 
theory of rent to my average cost of production equation.
4. Whether we proceed in one direction or the other, the aim of the 
operation is the same. We see immediately, once the operation has 
been inished, that my equation or Mr. Wicksteed’s, to which the for-
mula of the English theory of rent is reduced, cannot be specially 
applicable to the determination of the price of land services ( pt or 
dP
dA) to the exclusion of the determination of the prices of the ser-
vices of personal faculties (pp or dP

dB) and of capital goods (pk or 

dP
dC).  
his is what I meant by saying: ‘hus all that remains of Ricardo’s 
theory ater a rigorous critique is that rent is not an element, but a 
result, of the price of products. Now, the same thing can be said of 
wages and interest’ (Éléments, § 310). hat is what Mr. Wicksteed 
means when he writes: ‘Rent is not the cause but the efect of the 
exchange value of the product’ we read in our books. Precisely so, 
and since the law of rent is also the law of wages and the law of inter-
est, it is equally true that “wages are not the cause but the efect of 
the exchange value of the product”. And so too with interest’. (Essay, 
p. 47). I could cite in this respect several other passages in the Essay 
(p. 18, line 14; ibid., line 6), that, like the preceding passage, seem to 
be translated from the Éléments (p. 367, line 18; p. 369, line 18) and 
that the author could, in a pinch, have put in quotation marks while 
using this opportunity to mention my work.
5. here are, however, several diferences between the book in which 
I have endeavored, since 1874–77, ‘to make clear how a certain 


506 Appendixes

distribution of products results from a given distribution of services’ 
(Elements, § 219) and Mr. Wicksteed’s Essay on the Coordination of 
the Laws of Distribution that he published in 1894.
Ater noting that what can be said about rent can also be said about 
wages and interest, I add: ‘Consequently, rent, wages, interest, the 
prices of products, and the coeicients of production are all in the 
same problem, and must be determined all together and not inde-
pendently of one another’ (Éléments, § 310). And, in consequence, 
I combine my system of equations expressing equality between price 
and average cost with the system of equations expressing equality 
between the demand and supply of services, and with the systems of 
equations of the supply of services and of the demand for products; 
and I show how free competition, by solving all these equations, 
determines all their unknowns. Mr. Wicksteed has done nothing like 
that. As I said, earlier, he leaves his equation
P = F(A, B,C)
in a form capable of expressing either the quantity, or the value of the 
product, or, as he puts it, either a ‘physical product’ or a ‘commercial 
product’; he shows up to what point, in each case, the function is 
equal to the sum of the products of the partial diferential coeicients 
multiplied by the variables; how, consequently, the rate of remuner-
ation of each factor is the diferential coeicient of the product with 
respect to the quantity of that factor; and he furnishes a geometrical 
theory of the rate of remuneration of the service capital + labor that 
is perfectly symmetrical with the theory of rent he disproves. It is not 
my intention to evaluate that part of Mr. Wicksteed’s work; however 
interesting it may be, I doubt if it authorizes his declaring that: ‘I am 
not aware that any satisfactory attempt has been made to state what 
may be called the new theory of Distribution in its entirety; and still 
less have its relations to the old theory been deined’(Essay, p. 3),ii and 
ofering us his opuscule to ill that gap.
September 1894.
P.S. hat doubt was well founded. In a note that has just been 
communicated to me, Enrico Barone has assessed the part of Mr. 
Wicksteed’s work on which I had reserved judgment; and the follow-
ing is my understanding of that critique.


Mr. Wicksteed’s refutation of the English theory of rent 507

Mr. Wicksteed rigorously demonstrates his proposition for the 
case in which his equation is homogeneous and linear and identical 
to mine. In this case, in fact, the diferentials are respectively propor-
tional to their variables; and since we have
dP dP

= + + dC dC +

But he has not demonstrated it for the case in which his equation is neither 
homogeneous nor linear; that is to say, for the case in which the coei-
cients of production vary with the quantity produced. Mr. Barone, on the 
other hand, has demonstrated it in this case by means of my equation
Db pb = Dbbt pt ++ Dbbp pp ++ Dbbk pk +.
that is
Pπ = Apa + Bpb + Cpc , (1)
and of my equation
φ(bt ,,bp ,,bk ,) = 0
which, already modiied by Mr. Pareto by the introduction of Db, 
becomes
φ(bt ,,bp ,,bk ,,Db ) = 0
and which Mr. Barone puts into the form
Db = φ(Dbbt ,,Dbbp ,,Dbbk ,)
that is,
P = φ(A, B,C,), (2)


508 Appendixes

which is Mr. Wicksteed’s equation that may be assumed to be non-
homogeneous and non-linear and in which P is a quantity and not a 
value of the product.

Now, the entrepreneur who is undertaking tatonnements adds to 
or subtracts from the quantity of each productive service according 
as the value of the increment of this service is less than or greater 
than the value of the increment of the product that this increment of 
service produces, in such a manner as to arrive at the equalities

2 he meaning of the diferentiation and the agreement of practice with the theory 
is made apparent by saying, following the course of the demonstration of which 
I made use for the theorem of maximum satisfaction of new capital goods, that: 
in the state of equilibrium, the minimum average cost is equal to the price when 
the partial diferential increments of cost pertaining to each of the productive 
services are: 1o equal to one another, otherwise, it would be proitable for the 
entrepreneur to substitute certain services for others; and 2o equal to the partial 
diferential increments of receipts relative to each service, otherwise the entre-
preneur would have occasion either to increase or decrease his output; that is to 
say, when
π = ∆P = pa∆A = pb∆B = pc ∆C = 

or when, inally, the marginal productivities are equal to the rates of 
remuneration.

herefore: 1o Free competition leads to minimum average cost;
2o Under that regime, the rate of remuneration of each service is 
equal to the partial derivative of the production function, that is, 
to its marginal productivity, in accordance with equations (3);
3o he total quantity of the output is distributed among the product-
ive services, in accordance with equation (4).
hat triple proposition constitutes the ‘theory of marginal prod-
uctivity’,3 a very important theory, irst, because it introduces into the 
problem of production system (3) of equations in which the latter are 
equal in number to the number of coeicients of production and in 
which those coeicients igure as unknowns; and, second, because 
it thereby makes possible a critique and deinitive refutation of the 
English theory of rent, by showing that the consideration of mar-
ginal productivity is applicable to the determination of the coei-
cients of production, but not to the determination of the prices of 
services, precisely as I said in lesson 31, Mr. Barone deduced that 
very rigorously from my theory of economic equilibrium; and Mr. 
Wicksteed, who did not succeed in establishing it for the more gen-
eral case, would have been better inspired if he had not exerted him-
self to appear ignorant of the work of his predecessors.iii

developed form, in the Giornale degli Economisti.


510 Appendixes

iii Walras wrote the following section [Fonds Walras, V 1] for this appendix, 
with three alternative constructions that we have put in brackets, but he 
deleted it before settling on the inal version:
hus, assuming that the coordination of the laws of distribution depends 
essentially on the theory of marginal productivity, that coordination 
would have been, if not accomplished, at least well on the way to being 
accomplished before the eforts of Mr. Wicksteed, who did not perfect it; 
and he would have been better inspired to render more justice to those 
who had preceded him. But did the coordination of the laws of distribu-
tion depend on the theory of marginal productivity? I leave the discussion 
of that question to others. In my opinion, the truth is rather the contrary. 
he theory of marginal productivity once having been elucidated [devel-
oped correctly], as it is in substance in Mr. Barone’s note [translated by 
Walras as ‘Sur un livre récent de Wicksteed’, 1895, in Walras 1965, vol. 
2, pp. 644–8], it is immediately seen that it introduces simultaneously 
into the body of the theory of production, a certain number of unknowns 
that are the coeicients of production bt ,,bp ,,bk , , assumed to be 
variable and that depend not only on each other but also on the quantity 
produced, and an equal number of equations: the equations of marginal 
productivity, which are none other than the equations of minimum aver-
age cost that I indicated but did not furnish (Éléments, §§ 200, 274). As 
for the unknowns, which are the prices of the services pt ,, pp ,, pk ,, 
and as for the equations that serve to determine them, they are the subject 
of another part of the theory of production. Now, this other part can be 
developed, abstraction being made from the determination of the coef-
icients of production; while that determination, on the contrary, assumes 
that the prices of the services are determined, since it rests upon the dif-
ferentiation of the equation of average cost. he more I think about it, 
the more I am persuaded that fundamentally Mr. Wicksteed, in giving us 
the theory of marginal productivity having in mind the purpose of the 
coordination of the laws of distribution, tries (without at all succeeding) 
to furnish us the equations of minimum average cost having in mind the 
determination of the prices of the services, a confusion thanks to which 
he still has one foot in the theory of Ricardo’s from which he believes he 
is completely free. But see what has happened! He tries especially to solve 
the problem that I have already solved; and that is why he has only half 
solved the one that still remained to be solved. Messrs. Pareto and Barone 
proceed diferently: they [are the irst that] do not claim to refute me by 
proving that I have not all by myself completed mathematical economic 
theory, and they do not set themselves the task of redoing what I have 
done. hey take the science as it is at the point to which I have brought 
it and let it, and propose to continue on with it ater me; and hence they 
arrive at results that are important and new, complete and deinitive.
